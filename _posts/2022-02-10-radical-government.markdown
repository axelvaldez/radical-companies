**In 2009, the United States Bureau of Economics reported that the total value of land in the country was $23 trillion. A Forbes writer estimated that the rental value of that land, which George wanted to tax at 100 percent, made up roughly 5 percent of the total, or $1.15 trillion. If the land-value tax were adopted as the sole means of raising government revenue, it would have funded less than half of the federal budget that year, and none of the budgets of all 50 states and thousands of cities, towns, and counties.**

In the book RADICAL COMPANIES, we considered how the RADICAL model would work in a company environment. Other than a mention here and there, we said next to nothing about money, land, or governments.

In COIN, I laid out my ideas about money and what it would look like in a decentralized, transparent world. In LAND, I put down my thoughts on how land would be handled in a RADICAL world.

In this document I finally get to lay down some my thoughts, albeit unpolished, about government.

## Very Different

National governments are the ultimate centralized power. Dictatorships are the most centralized, and democratic governments the least, but they all centralize power. They have a monopoly on force: national governments run the military and state governments and cities run police forces.

In the RADICAL model, governments would not be able to collect taxes since the moral equivalent of land taxes go directly into local community funds and only a trickle of it goes to more centralized centers of power.

In any case, in the RADICAL model society’s governance would be decentralized and not like today’s national governments. RADICAL societal governance will be based on scarcity and competition as it is in the FIAT system.

## City Government

A local government must be granted power by the State. This is probably a leftover from the days of Royalty, where the rules had to issue a charter (and charged for doing so).

City governments are responsible for,

- The police force, fire abatement, paramedic help.
- Traffic infrastructure (e.g., signs, speed zones).
- Local city road construction and maintenance, including public parking for cars and motorcycles.
- Building regulations and zoning.
- Keeping water clean and maintaining sewer lines.
- Waste removal.
- Parks and recreation.
- Municipal courts.

Another thing that our present day’s cities get involved in is economic development. Let’s start with that because that is where the wheels of “government of the people, by the people, for the people” start to come off.
