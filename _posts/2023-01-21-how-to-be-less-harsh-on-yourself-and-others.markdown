<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Human competition is pervasive. It is natural but not our nature.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>As quoted in Maria Popova&rsquo;s post,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> Ram Dass drew on the human-tree analogy,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>When you go out into the woods and you look at trees, you see all these different trees. &hellip; You just allow it. You appreciate the tree.</p>
   <p>The minute you get near humans, you lose all that. And you are constantly saying, “You’re too this, or I’m too this.” That judging mind comes in.</p>
  </div>
 <p>In other words, when surrounded by people, competition sets in. That is what we have learned.</p>
 <p>Tragically, we miss out on what competion hides,</p>
   <p> When a tree is very small we protect it by surrounding it with a fence so that animals do not step on it. Later when the tree is bigger it no longer needs the fence. <em>Then it can give shelter to many</em>. (emphasis added)</p>
  </div>
  <p>We need to learn to &ldquo;just allow it&rdquo; and collaborate.</p>
 <p>Maria closes with this powerful statement,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>The fence is the community of support, &hellip; the kindred spirits with whom we surround ourselves when we are still vulnerable &hellip; a lovely reminder of that mycelial connection that binds us to each other, just like the mycorrhizal network undergirds the forest with its web of communication and nutrition.</p>
