 <p>Politics is local, it starts at the grassroots. RBuddyneighbor build communities of neighbors who know each other, can talk to each other, and can act together.</p>
</div>

<h1>Origin Story</h1>
 <p>In 2018, my good friend Jose Contreras sent me a text out of the blue. This ended up as <em>rBuddyNeighbor</em>.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>Since then we have learned quite a bit and here I try to revise it a bit.</p>

<h1>Members Are the Only Customer</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>People must first become members of <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> to participate (<em>i.e.</em>, of course, there could be trials).</li>
  <li>People are our only customers.</li>
  <li>Members co-own everything about <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span>.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Two Scenarios</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> platform helps put <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>s physically in front of each other. This way they can bond by <em>doing something for each other</em>. A <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> needs something, the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> takes care of it, they get to know each other a little better, and they both get to feel good about themselves.</p>

    <th>Happy Example</th>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span>, Nam, goes to Safeway at around 11 pm.</li>
      <li>A few minutes before, a <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>, Kim, put in a request for a, <span class="_quotespan">A gallon of 2% milk, Organic Valley preferred, by midnight. Otherwise, bring me a half gallon of whatever they have. If it&rsquo;s going to take you more than one hour, ignore this, please (I need to go to sleepâ€”got early meetings tomorrow).</span></li>
      <li>When Nam gets to Safeway, the system alerts him of this request and adds, <span class="_quotespan">This will take you an extra five to ten minutes and approximately three blocks out of your route.</span></li>
      <li>Nam reviews the request and gets to see Kim&rsquo;s <span class="_quotespan">vitals&rdquo; (<em>e.g.</em>, &ldquo;single male, currently alone, thinks stabbing dolls is LOLZ</span> or <span class="_quotespan">mom of three</span><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>). This is the kind of information that this Nam needs to know before he can safely accept a request.</li>
      <li>Nam accepts the request.</li>
      <li>The system summarizes, and displays something like, <span class="_quotespan">You are promising to deliver one gallon of Organic Valley 2% milk to Kim at&hellip;</span></li>
     </ul>
     <p>So far, the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> doesn&rsquo;t know anything. Once she accepts the request, the system will let Kim know that, <span class="_quotespan">Your request for Organic Valley 2% milk has been accepted. We&rsquo;ll charge $2.70 to your account. Do you still want it?</span></p>
     <ul>
      <li>Kim still wants it!</li>
      <li>Nam gets his stuff, including Kim&rsquo;s milk, stands in line, and pays for the goods.</li>
      <li>As Nam leaves Safeway,<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> the system alerts Kim, <span class="_quotespan">Your 2% Organic Valley milk is on its way and will get to you in about 10 minutes.</span></li>
      <li>As Nam gets close to Kim&rsquo;s home, <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> alerts her again, <span class="_quotespan">Your <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span>, Nam (and avatar) is about to get to your home with your Organic Valley 2% milk.</span></li>
      <li>Nam parks, but his girlfriend walks to Kim&rsquo;s front door.</li>
      <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> communicates with Nam through the app, <span class="_quotespan">Hey, there&rsquo;s a young woman at my door, is she with you?</span></li>
      <li>Nam realizes her concern and says, <span class="_quotespan">Oh, yes, she is my girlfriend. I&rsquo;ll come up, too. Sorry about that.</span></li>
      <li>She comes up, Kim opens the door, and they talk. Name points to their place down the street, Kim tells them about getting the kids fed in the morning, Nam tells her about a Neighborhood event scheduled for the weekend, they talk about the Farmer Markets in the area, &hellip;</li>
      <li>Kim accepts the delivery and adds a note to it, <span class="_quotespan">Got the milk and got to meet a very nice couple, Nam and her girlfriend.</span></li>
     </ul>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Not-so-Happy Example</th>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>Nam, the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span>, never shows up and Kim tells us that she is closing his request because, <span class="_quotespan">the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> never got here.</span></li>
      <li>Then we&rsquo;ll tell the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> something like, <span class="_quotespan">Sorry about what happened. Obviously, we won&rsquo;t be charging anything to your account. We are donating the yield of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s to the <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> to build a Neighborhood gym. In any case, if you&rsquo;d like, we can let you know what Nam has to say about breaking his promise. Please, let us know if you&rsquo;re interested.</span></li>
      <li>We&rsquo;ll ask Nam, <span class="_quotespan">What happened, you broke your promise to Kim!</span></li>
      <li>His response might be, <span class="_quotespan">I had to go straight home right away because my neighbor found my dog in her backyard. I was all flustered and forgot to let Kim know. Later, I was just embarrassed.</span> Or he could say, <span class="_quotespan">Halfway there my girlfriend was pretty freaked out, so I didn&rsquo;t show up. I should have said something.</span></li>

 <p>Either way, the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> and the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> get to note their level of satisfaction; and given Transparency, the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> and the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> get to see each other&rsquo;s response, and that is how they learn.</p>

    <th>Mom-and-Pops</th>
    <td>
     <p>During a conversation, Minesh Patel brought up the use case of a local mom-and-pop store who may deliver a request themselves. It could be that they know the requester as a <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> or as a regular customer. Or the requestor lives within their back route and the local grocers can easily deliver it on the way home. This would fit within the model.<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
     <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>-owner cannot charge or add a surcharge for the delivery itself. Tips are not allowed, because it is not about making a living, it is about connecting and simply being a <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> to a <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>.</p>
     <p>This could be <span class="_quotespan">gamed</span> if the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>-owner hires one or more people to deliver these requests. This would go against the principle of connecting people IRL. A <span class="_paradigm">delivery</span> person would not make the kind of connection we are aiming for between <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>s. This can easily be detected by the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>s and reported to the platform. It would end up in a conversation, probably between the grocer and the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>. Or, if the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> is reticent to do this, then somebody from <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbor</span> would do it.</p>

     <p>Even the people who like to cook, sometimes feel like not cooking. It&rsquo;s like harking for a special dish, but you don&rsquo;t want to make it or don&rsquo;t know how to cook it.</p>

     <p>Regardless of what you think of these things, this would go against the Explicit Alignment of<span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbor</span>. So, we&rsquo;d probably have to do something about it, although not sure what.</p>
     <p>Scanning requests will not work after a short while, and people will go crypto on us (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="_quotespan">Looking for a one-night-stand. I&rsquo;ll pay $300&rdquo; will become <span class="_quotespan">Looking for my friend, Mike. I want to return his $300.</span> Maybe we can spot patterns (<em>e.g.</em>, the same person always responds to the &ldquo;Mike</span> requests).</p>
     <p>When we detect any of this, we could kick the &ldquo;Mike&rdquo; character out (and return their membership fees). But that is a use of force.</p>
     <p>It is not a matter of rules, we already have the Explicit Alignment to guide us. No matter, in the end the members/co-owners need to do something about it.</p>
