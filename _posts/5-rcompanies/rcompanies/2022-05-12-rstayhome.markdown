      <td>Here is where the projects are listed. There may be a single <span class='_paradigm'>Mission</span> or many of these going on at one time. This is not your traditional Gantt chart, rather each is an experiment. The <em>what</em> is the expected results (<em>i.e.</em>, the hypotheses), the <em>when</em> is an estimate, and the <em>how</em> is optional. If you are not really sure of your approach, you should state the <em>how</em> so others can help you.</td>

       <p>Your explicit profile is something that you maintain to let others know about you, what gives you joy, what bothers you, etc. There are no right or wrong answers. It is not a resume or a LinkedIn profile. It is as close as possible to what you really feel.</p>
       <p>Our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> training goes against being vulnerable, <span class='_quotespane'>because people can use it against you.</span> But others can&rsquo;t help you without knowing you. For the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model to work, you have to lead with trust and the Explicit Profile is a tool you can use to trust others so they can trust you.</p>
