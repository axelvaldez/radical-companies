 <p>rMedia Tools.</p>
</div>

<h1>rReader</h1>
 <p>A reader app that works with ebooks and platforms (<em>e.g.</em>, Kindle).</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <h1>Features</h1>
       <p>While on or near a PRADERA SHELF, the READER app can be used to,</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Download, listen to, or watch content.</li>
         <li>Upload reviews and other content (i.e., as text, audio, or video).</li>
         <li>Read a book.</li>
         <li>Download the digital book at a discount or get a discount coupon (<em>e.g.</em>, QR code) to buy a paper copy of the book at the hosting store.</li>
        </ul>
     </td>
     <td>
      <h1>Highlights</h1>
       <p>The READER allows readers to highlight from one word to a whole fragment. As opposed to the Kindle, a &ldquo;word&rdquo; does not include adjacent punctuation (<em>e.g</em>, single and double quotes, commas, periods, colons, semicolons, ellipses, dashes, parentheses, brackets, and exclamation and question marks) although the user may include it manually by adjusting the selection one character at a time.</p>
       <p>In addition to highlighting, the READER can support underlines, boxes, and other forms of emphasis alone or in combination.</p>

<h1>rShelf</h1>
 <p>The PRADERA SHELF could bring new life to small booksellers and make their business more profitable.</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <h1>Features</h1>
       <p>Retailers would have an area, called the SHELF, dedicated to PRADERA MEDIA content.</p>
       <p>Later, retailers could include other publishers, but they would have to pay a fee to the store for the privilege (at that point the store would probably have to buy the SHELF).</p>
       <p>Mobile phones and pads will readily connect to the SHELF to,</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Download/listen/watch content.</li>
         <li>Upload reviews and other content, such as text, audio, or video (see PRADERA MAKE).</li>
         <li>Download the first few chapters of a book for free or the whole book at a discount.</li>
         <li>Get a discount coupon to buy a paper copy of the book at the hosting store.</li>
         <li>See PRADERA READER.</li>
        </ul>
       <p>The Shelf is designed to be noticeable. A couple of elevated chairs could serve as a Shelf or maybe a single booth. This would be a space for quiet reading and also for readers to meet and talk (<em>i.e.</em>, instant book clubs). </p>
       <p>Whatâ€™s disruptive about this is that the Shelf is different and becomes a conversation piece (<em>i.e.</em>, love or hate it, it gets mentioned online). Also,</p>
        <ul>
         <li>The store gets increased foot traffic.</li>
         <li>More book copies are sold.</li>
         <li>PRADERA MEDIA gets all (opt-in) contact info (opt-in) collected at the Shelf.</li>
        </ul>
       <p>Footprints could span from a single-user booth, to a platform with several chairs in it, or even a counter where people could sit and read.</p>
