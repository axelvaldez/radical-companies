 <p>If culture and civilization, the Anthropocne, is to have a future we need to embrace this critical moment in our relationship with ourselves, our communities, and planet to ensure their survival.</p>
 <p>We no longer deny that, throughout the world, we have had a dramatic and significantly negative impact on the environment, our life-support system. If we want our discovery and progress to survive, we must take steps to ensure its survival. We must question every single layer of the fabric of the current FIAT system, the “normal” way we do things.</p>

<h1>Ownership</h1>
 <p>In particular, we need a dramatic change in the way we understand ownership. The “normal,” FIAT way is to view ownership as a given: one or a few people are owners and everybody else works for them to make a living. Things have been getting better and have progressed so that must be a sign that the system is working for us all and that has been the end of the discussion. In fact, that assumption is leading us to a disastrous fall over the proverbial cliff.</p>
 <p>Ownership is a human invention and a very good one at that. Ownership care for their property, etc. I am not sure if that is the way it really works or that is the way that it has worked out, but, in any case, let’s go with that assumption. Then ownership, as a good thing, should be spread out to everybody, not just a few.</p>

<h1>Jobs</h1>
 <p>“Jobs” are the direct descendants of slavery, and I don’t mean to exaggerate. People are no longer forced to do specific work until their (early) death, and that’s good. Now they can go from employer to employer to “improve their lot.” They get to sell their labor capacity to the highest bidder. They can be sold, but they <em>have to</em> sell themselves. Owners don’t, they simply get to take the profits from other people’s labor.</p>

<h1>Amazon</h1>
 <p>Look at Jeff Bezos. He really worked hard, took a huge risk on the Internet, changed a lot of things in the way publishers did business, and, in spite of “Wall Street” demands to the contrary, he invested profits for a long time and created a hardware business and a Cloud business that created the Cloud space. He did this until his business became the big kahuna and he had become one of the biggest owners in the world.</p>
 <p>Besides MacKensie Scot, his wife at a time, the original investors were his parents who had been able to accumulate $300,000 in their retirement fund and gave it to Jeff to get started. They didn’t rob anybody to get that money: his father went to school, became an engineer, and that skill got him a high pay and generous benefits; his mom supported both of them with her work with her tenacity.</p>
 <p>Amazon followed the “normal” business path: paid his workers salaries and kept profits for the owners. Ownership worked great for Jeff Bezos and Amazon’s investors. His employees did very well, but not as well as Jeff. “But he did much more…” I hear you thinking, “… and they had it safe and cozy.” Or they could also be forced to pee in a bottle and they didn’t benefit from the growth that they helped create.</p>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>If ownership worked great for Jeff Bezos, it should have worked great for everyone who helped create that wealth. But that takes a huge mindset change. First, we have to see the invisible: ownership is not a given, it is not sacred. It is a human invention, and it is good. If it has caused progress to happen all these centuries, imagine what it would do if <em>everybody</em> was an owner. Owners care for their property. Owners would own their creation. Owners will take care of their life support system, not use it as a garbage can while saying “that’s what Government is for, clean up!”</p>
 <p>We need a system that will eventually lead to universal co-ownership. As I can tell, that is the only path to saving the Anthropocene.</p>
