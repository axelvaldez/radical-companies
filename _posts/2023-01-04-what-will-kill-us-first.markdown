 <p>Which will destroy the Anthropocene first, climate change or homogeneity?</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Which will destroy the Anthropocene<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> first, climate change or homogeneity?</p>

<h1>Climate Change</h1>
 <p>First, take climate change,</p>
 <ul> 
  <li>Changes to temperature patterns change weather patterns.</li>
  <li>Changes to weather patterns change agricultural growth patterns and wild species habitats (<em>i.e.</em>, even more so and faster than we have).</li>
  <li>Changes to agriculture and wild species habitats are a threat to our life support system.</li>
  <li>We cannot react to that many changes. As our life support system declines, our population will decline.</li>
  <li>Given our <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> mindset, competition will increase and our cultural accomplishments will be forgotten.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The other thing happening now is the trend towards homogeneity in many fields.</p>

<h1>Homogeneity in Politics</h1>
 <p>This move towards homogeneity is not &ldquo;coming&rdquo;, it is already happening and here are a couple of examples. Take governance, for example.</p>
 <p>As every nation moves towards being run like every other nation, experimentation goes down and nations approach an inevitable, all powerful, forever state. Today we can still compare, for example, the US to Europe when it comes to, say, healthcare. But as homogeneity sets in, distinctions will be minimal and easily brushed off.</p>

<h1>Decline of Science</h1>
 <p>For another example, take the decline of disruptive science,</p>
 <div class="_quotation">
  <p>The number of science and technology research papers published has skyrocketed over the past few decades &ndash; but the &lsquo;disruptiveness&rsquo; of those papers has dropped. &hellip;</p>
  <p>Data from millions of manuscripts show that, compared with the mid-twentieth century, research done in the 2000s was much more likely to incrementally push science forward than to veer off in a new direction and render previous work obsolete. Analysis of patents from 1976 to 2010 showed the same trend.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">2&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 </div>
 <p>This is happening across diverse fields. For example, social science, technology, physical sciences, life sciences, and biomedicine.</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/disruptive-science-dwindles.svg"
   width="100%"
   alt="">
 </div>
 <p>In sheer numbers, there is more research, but it trends towards improvement and not discovery. This is really bad because we can recognize and celebrate improvements (&ldquo;Wow, that’s going to make us live longer!&rdquo;), but we don’t recognize discoveries until it hits us in the face (&ldquo;WAT? We can generate energy like the Sun does?&rdquo;).</p>

<h1>Fragile Food</h1>
 <p>Another example comes from our food supply: food productiopn is getting more and more fragile as we consume fewer and fewer food varieties.<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">3&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 <div class="_quotation">
  <p>&ldquo;The ways in which plants are used by societies around the world have narrowed drastically over the past 500 years.&rdquo;<a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">4&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Crop growers worldwide face enormous challenges. Plants are becoming less resistant to pests and diseases. Crops are more likely to be damaged or fail because of droughts, heatwaves, floods, salinization and rising sea levels. Soils are degraded; rivers and watersheds are polluted; and the diversity and abundance of crop pollinators are in steep decline.&rdquo;</p>
 </div>

<h1>Strong Trend</h1>
 <p>Politically, our priorities are trending towards tweaking and avoiding risk. Worst, this trend is bringing about a world-wide monoculture in every aspect of our lives, in politics,<a href="#en05"><sup id="bm05">5&nbsp;</sup></a> science, food, etc.</p>

<h1>Monoculture</h1>
 <p>Monocultures are fragile. A virus that kills one member of the species, can kill <em>every</em> member of the species.</p>
 <p>Nature fends this off somewhat via genetic and habitat variations. This will allow a handful of individuals to survive, though some cultural knowledge will vanish as individuals die.</p>
 <p>Non-human species don’t accumulate as much cultural knowledge, but humans accumulate a lot of it. We will lose much, if not most, of it.</p>
 <p>We will most likely get a chance to restart, but with a decimated community. The whole thing will be very fragile as we restart from near-scratch.</p>

<h1>The Anthropocene</h1>
 <p>This will happen to humanity, and the Anthropocene will end, if we don’t do something about the direction we are going. Our gasoline car is heading towards world-wide homogeneity and climate change.</p>

<h1>RADICAL Mindset</h1>
 <p>One way to protect us against this is the RADICAL mindset. If we manage to spread it widely, then we will have a chance to not end up in the same place we are today, with competition rampant, and domination as the only humanity-wide <em>umwelt</em>.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
 <p>The RADICAL model consists of the RADICAL foundation, its tools, and new skills.</p>

<h1>The RADICAL Foundation</h1>

   <td>Inspired by J Kim Wright&rsquo;s Concious Contracts&reg;, these apply to <em>individuals</em> as they create or enter a <em>community</em>.

   <td>There are going to be more tools in the future. For example, specialized and community-specific tools</td>

<h1>The Skills</h1>
 <p>They include the capacity,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>To be inquisitive over being accusative</li>
  <li>To be playful over being rigid</li>
  <li>To consider behavior from love rather than from harm</li>
 </ul>
