 <p>Which will destroy the Anthropocene<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> first, climate change or homogeneity?</p>

<h1>Climate Change</h1>
 <p>Climate change is by now an obvious one,</p>
 <ul> 
  <li>Changes to temperature patterns change weather patterns.</li>
  <li>Changes to weather patterns change agricultural growth patterns and wild species habitats (<em>i.e.</em>, even more so and faster than we have).</li>
  <li>Changes to agriculture and wild species habitats are a threat to our life support system.</li>
  <li>We cannot react to that many changes. As our life support system declines, our population will decline.</li>
  <li>Given our <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> mindset, competition will increase and our cultural accomplishments will be forgotten.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Homogeneity</h1>
 <p>As every nation moves towards being run like every other nation, experimentation goes down and approaches a bland state. This state becomes inevitable, all powerful, forever.</p>
 <p>Today we can still compare, for example, the US to Europe when it comes to well-being. As every nation moves towards being run like every other nation, distinctions will be minimal and easily brushed off.</p>

<h1>Decline of Science</h1>
 <p>Take, for example, the decline of disruptive science,</p>
 <div class="_quotation">
  <p>The number of science and technology research papers published has skyrocketed over the past few decades &ndash; but the &lsquo;disruptiveness&rsquo; of those papers has dropped. &hellip;</p>
  <p>Data from millions of manuscripts show that, compared with the mid-twentieth century, research done in the 2000s was much more likely to incrementally push science forward than to veer off in a new direction and render previous work obsolete. Analysis of patents from 1976 to 2010 showed the same trend.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">2</sup></a></p>
 </div>
 <p>This is happening across diverse fields. For example, social science, technology, physical sciences, life sciences, and biomedicine.</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img

   width="70%"
   alt="">
 </div>
 <p>In sheer number, there is more research, but it trends towards improvement and not discovery. This is really bad because we can recognize and celebrate improvements (&ldquo;Wow, that’s going to make us live longer!&rdquo;), but we don’t recognize discoveries until it hits us in the face (&ldquo;WAT? We can generate energy like the Sun does?&rdquo;).</p>
 <p>Politically, our priorities will trend towards improvements.</p>
 <p>The worst part is that it will create a world-wide monoculture.</p>

<h1>Monoculture</h1>
 <p>Monocultures are fragile. A virus that kills one member of the species, can kill <em>every</em> member of the species.</p>
 <p>Nature fends this off somewhat via genetic and habitat variations. This will allow a handful of individuals to survive, though some cultural knowledge will vanish as individuals die.</p>
 <p>Non-human species don’t accumulate as much cultural knowledge, but humans accumulate a lot of it. We will lose much, if not most, of it.</p>
 <p>We will most likely get a chance to restart, but with a decimated community. The whole thing will be very fragile as we restart from near-scratch.</p>

<h1>The Anthropocene</h1>
 <p>This will happen to humanity, and the Anthropocene will end, if we don’t do something about the direction we are going. Our gasoline car is heading towards world-wide homogeneity and climate change.</p>

<h1>RADICAL Mindset</h1>
 <p>One way to protect us against this is the RADICAL mindset. If we manage to spread it widely, then we will have a chance to not end up in the same place we are today, with competition rampant, and domination as the only humanity-wide <em>umwelt</em>.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
 <p>The RADICAL model consists of the RADICAL foundation, its tools, and new skills.</p>

<h1>The Skills</h1>
 <p>They include the capacity,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>To be inquisitive over being accusative</li>
  <li>To be playful over being rigid</li>
  <li>To consider behavior from love rather than harm</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The community will be the holder of these and other skills.</p>
