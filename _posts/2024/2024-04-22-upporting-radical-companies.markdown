<h1>Motivation?</h1>
 <p>Here they are as an Ensemble of <a href="" <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RADICAL-Companies-Organized-Success-Employees/dp/1641846429/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zvWE1R0NDgL0e3yOQZ7SpbwPHIK23BUmdM6k3YRnWNPP66f8I60T-38roNtx8HMwoy8k1N6BYtOJzu7mSmeJeCI_C_jj7MjE3C1xZp1d1NY.DBHRTPyYr81wye-tlbSuMNfmCUX0Pk-yfvXl43EpA8Y&qid=1726525947&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Radical Companies</a>,</p>

 <p>(The little &lsquo;<em>r</em>&rsquo; stands for Radical)</p>
 <p>The new idea, suggested by Jose, is to make them Franchises, but not Fiat Franchises. The Radical Franchise would have no capital owners.</p>
 <p>The Radical franchis<em>or</em> and the  Radical franchis<em>ees</em> will be at the same level as all other participants: they will co-owners of the Radical Franchise.</p>

<h1>The Radical Franchise</h1>
 <p>The Radical Franchise itself will be an Ensemble of companies providing services (<em>e.g.</em>, purchasing, accounting, legal, recycling, etc).</p>

<h1>How It Starts</h1>
 <p>It all starts with loans,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The company needs a web site and the help of a lawyer</li>
   <li>The website may cost, for example, $1,000, $750 his cost and $250 in profit. An amount, say the $750 cost, gets paid immediately, the $250 becomes a loan</li>
   <li>The lawyer can set things up legally for $1,500, her costs is $750, her profit is $750. The $750 cost, gets paid immediately, the other $750 becomes a loan.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The lawyer and web maker may assume the risk for them loan or the new Radical Franchisee may need a Radical loan to cover the amount that must be paid immediately.</p>

<h1>Loan Payments</h1>
 <p>An agreement is worked out with each lender.</p>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s assume that new Radical Franchisee can pay $200 every month which will be distributed relative to what is owed,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>20% ($40) may go to the web page maker</.i>
   <li>80% ($160) may go to the lawyer.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>That is how a community can help companies get started. Ths how the entrepreneur can get advise from the lawyer or the web maker.</p>
