 <p>Once upon a time we described several Radical companies. This is another motivation.</p>
</div>

<h1>Motivation?</h1>
 <p>Once upon a time we imagined several Radical companies,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/12/rstayhome" target="_blank">rStayHome</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/13/rkare" target="_blank">rKare</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/14/rclean" target="_blank">rClean</a></li>
  </ul>
 <p>(The little &lsquo;<em>r</em>&rsquo; stands for Radical)</p>
 <p>The new idea, suggested by Jose, is to make them Franchises, but not Fiat Franchises. The Radical Franchise would have no capital owners, instead the Radical franchis<em>or</em> and the  Radical franchis<em>ees</em> will be at the same level as the others participants. They will co-owners of the Radical Franchise.</p>

<h1>The Radical Franchise</h1>
 <p>The Radical Franchise itself will be an Ensemble of companies providing services the Radical Franchisees require (<em>e.g.</em>, purchasing, recycling, accounting, legal, etc).</p>

<h1>How It Starts</h1>
 <p>It all starts with loans.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The small company needs a web site and the help of a lawyer</li>
   <li>The website may cost, for example, $1,000, $750 his cost and $250 in profit. An amount, say the $750 cost, gets paid immediately, the $250 becomes a loan</li>
   <li>The lawyer can set things up legally for $1,500, her costs is $750, her profit is $750. The $750 cost, gets paid immediately, the other $750 becomes a loan.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The lawyer and web maker may assume the risk for them loan or the new Radical Franchisee may need a loan to cover the amount that must be paid immediately.</p>

<h1>The Account</h1>
 <p>Assuming the loan, an agreement is worked out with each lender.</p>

<h1>Loan Payments</h1>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s assume that new Radical Franchisee can pay $200 every month which will be distributed relative to what is owed,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>20% ($40) would go to the web page maker</.i>
   <li>80% ($160) would go to the lawyer.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Help</h1>
 <p>That is how a community can help companies get started. Otherwise the would-be entrepreneur can get advise, (<em>e.g.</em>, the lawyer, the web maker, or somebody else) on how to improve his chances to get a loan.</p>
