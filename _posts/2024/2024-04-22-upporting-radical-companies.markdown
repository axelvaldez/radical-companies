 <p>Once upon a time we described several Radical companies. This is another motivation.</p>
</div>

<h1>Motivation?</h1>
 <p>Once upon a time we imagined several Radical companies,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/12/rstayhome" target="_blank">rStayHome</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/13/rkare" target="_blank">rKare</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/14/rclean" target="_blank">rClean</a></li>
  </ul>
 <p>The new idea, suggested by Jose, is to make them franchises, but not Fiat Franchises. The Radical franchise would have no capital owners, instead the franchisor and the franchisees will be the same, and will be co-owners.</p>

<h1>The Franchise</h1>
 <p>The franchise itself will be an Ensemble of companies providing services the franchisees require (<em>e.g.</em>, purchasing, recycling, accounting, legal, etc).</p>

<h1>How It Starts</h1>
 <p>It all starts with loans. But a small company does not start wth a lot of cash as capital, a loan is needed.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The small company needs a web site and the help of a lawyer</li>
   <li>The web site normally costs $1,000, %750 for the website and $250 in profit: the $750 gets paid immediately by the new franchiseee, the $250 becomes a loan to the new franchisee</li>
   <li>The lawyer has to set things up legally and for that his costs is $750, his profit is $750: the $750 is paid immediately, the other $750 becomes a loan.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Loan Payments</h1>
 <p>The new franchisee pays $200 every month into the loan fund,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The $200 could get distributed according to the terms of the loan< or&hellip;/li>
   <li>Most likely the loan will get paid relative to what is owed: 20% ($40) would go to the web page maker and 80% ($160) would go to the lawyer</li>
   <li>A new loan could be folded into the loan fund or a new fund could be created.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>The Loan Fund</h1>
  <ul>
   <li>Would be used in case the small bussiness fails to pay his loans.</li>
   <li>May be created by the service providers, by a grant, or by pledged RADs.</li>
   <li>The fund itself could be a percentage of revenue, that means that it applies to everybody in the company.</li>
   <li>The most likely scenario is a Banner fund which applies individually to people who commit the yield of their pledged RADs. Thiansounds like the most Radical thing to do, but you will have to experiment.</li>
   <li>If a frachisee company is not generating enough of a fund, it may switched to a to default terms.</li>
  </ul>
