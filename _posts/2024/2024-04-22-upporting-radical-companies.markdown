 <p>Once upon a time we described several Radical companies. This is another motivation.</p>
</div>

<h1>Motivation?</h1>
 <p>Once upon a time we imagined several Radical companies,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/12/rstayhome" target="_blank">rStayHome</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/13/rkare" target="_blank">rKare</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/14/rclean" target="_blank">rClean</a></li>
  </ul>
 <p>The new idea, suggested by Jose, is to make them franchises, but not Fiat Franchises. The Radical Franchise would have no capital owners, instead the Radical Franchisor and the  Radical franchisees will be the same, co-owners of the Radical Franchise.</p>

<h1>The Radical Franchise</h1>
 <p>The Radical Franchise itself will be an Ensemble of companies providing services the Radical Franchisees require (<em>e.g.</em>, purchasing, recycling, accounting, legal, etc).</p>

<h1>How It Starts</h1>
 <p>It all starts with loans. But a small company does not start wth a lot of cash as capital, a loan may be needed.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The small company needs a web site and the help of a lawyer</li>
   <li>It may cost, for example, $1,000, $750 for the website and $250 in profit: the $750 gets paid immediately from the Radical Franchisee, the $250 becomes a loan</li>
   <li>The lawyer can set things up legally for $1,500 and for that his costs is $750, his profit is $750: the $750 is paid immediately, the other $750 becomes a loan.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The new Radical Franchisee may need a loan to cover the $1,500 that must be paid immediately.</p>

<h1>The Account</h1>
 <p>The account embodies the agreement that has been worked out with each lender.</p>
 <p>More that one lender could be included in an account if the same terms apply. Alternatvely, a lender may require a differebt aggrement, with a different account.</p>

<h1>Loan Payments</h1>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s assume that new Radical Franchisee can pay $200 every month into the loan account. These are terms that have been negotiat=ed with each lender,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Most likely the $200 will be distributed relative to what is owed: 20% ($40) would go to the web page maker and 80% ($160) would go to the lawyer. Other perxentages can be agreed to to change the length of the load. for example.</li>
   <li>A new loan could be folded into the loan account if it is willing to live with has been decided</li>
   <li>A new loand may need a different account to represent different agreements.</li>
  </ul>
