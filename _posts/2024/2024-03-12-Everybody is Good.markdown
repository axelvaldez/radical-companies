 <p>Everybody is trying to contribute (except maybe the mentally sick). For some, the mean is violence, for others, the mean is conversations. We must learn to teach conversations.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>From a very early age, everyboby wants to contribute. And I mean everybody.</p>
 <p>For reassurance, I looked at Jean Piaget&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>The Origins of Intelligence in Children.</em>&rdquo; (<em>i.e.</em>, first publised in 1956). Piaget lays out the book in Stages and at its Sixth Stage, &ldquo;<em>The Invention of New Means Through Mental Combinations</em>,&rdquo; intelligence appears.</p>
 <p>It is at this stage that the child needs to also start to learn how to communicate with their coomunity. Some parents do this brilliantly, but most do not do it at all<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> and simply go by the Fiat playbook, &ldquo;<em>be quiet.</em>&rdquo;</p>
 <p>I spite of it all, some people learn communicate via stories that are at the root of our humanity.</p>

<h1>All Good</h1>
 <p>No matter, from a very early age everyboby wants to contribute. This means that, amont other things, we need to learn to communicate from a very early age. When things come out in <em>childish</em> way, it is up to adults around the child to teach them how to say it in a more comprehensible ways. What we do mostly is to tell the child to <em>shut up</em>. Don&rsquo;t. Keep the children talking and teach them to speak in a way that make sense to the community, in a way that engages their humanity.</p>
 <p>That will grow up happy and will others live a happier live.</p>

<h1>Bad People, Good People</h1>
 <p>The difference with &ldquo;<em>bad people<?em>&rdquo; is that they <em>contribute</em> by way of violence. They impose their version of <em>good</em> on you. Feedback is at best ignored and at worst it become a capital offense. This leaves their version of <em>good</em> weak, but everything they say is law.</p>
 <p>The thing is that when it goes the route of violence, it becomes power over everything, including people. Violence begets more violence and it goes downhill from there. Hitler, in Geermany, and Putin, in Russia, are good examples of that: I want them to <em>fear</em> me and celebrate with my contribution. Fear me, <em>resistance is futile</em>.</p>
 <p>They started with good intentions, but then the noticed that the threat of violence was enough to control people.</p>
