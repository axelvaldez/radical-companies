 <p>Everybody is trying to contribute (except maybe the mentally sick). For some, the mean is violence, for others, the mean is conversations. We must learn to teach comnversations.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>I assume that from a very early age, everyboby wants to contribute. That is a radical assumption. For reassjurance, I looked at Jean Piaget&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>The Origins of Intellignce in Children.</em>&rdquo; It is a pretty old book (<em>i.e.</em>, 1956, 68 years ago).</p>
 <p>Piaget lays out the book in Stages and in its Sixth Stage, &ldquo;<em>The Invention of New Means Through Mental Combinations<em>,&rdquo; that is when intelligence appears. This happens somewhere between two and five. It is still childish reinvention.</p>
 <p>But pay attention because it is at this stage that the child needs to also learn how to communicate with their coomunity. Some parents do this brilliantly, but most do not do it at all.<span id="em01" style="font-size:smaller; text-align: justify; font-family:helvetica, sans-serif; font-style:italic; margin-bottom:3px; "><a href="">1</a></span></p>

 <h1></h1>
 <p>People who learn this learn, learn to communicate via stories. And stories are at the core of communities. And, my guess, is that they are at the core of our humanity.</p>
