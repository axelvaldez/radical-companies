 <p>Everybody is trying to contribute (except maybe the mentally sick). For some, the mean is violence, for others, the mean is conversations. We must learn to teach conversations.</p>

 <p>From a very early age, everyboby wants to contribute. For reassurance, I looked at Jean Piaget&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>The Origins of Intelligence in Children.</em>&rdquo; (<em>i.e.</em>, it is a pretty old bookfirst publised in 1956).</p>
 <p>Piaget lays out the book in Stages and in its Sixth Stage, &ldquo;<em>The Invention of New Means Through Mental Combinations</em>,&rdquo; intelligence appears.</p>
 <p>It is at this stage that the child needs to also start to learn how to communicate with their coomunity. Some parents do this brilliantly, but most do not do it at all.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> They simply go by the Fiat playbook, &ldquo;be quiet.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>I spite of it all, some people learn communicate via stories that are at the root of our humanity.</p>
