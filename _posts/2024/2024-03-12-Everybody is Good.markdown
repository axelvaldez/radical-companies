 <p>Everybody is trying to contribute (except maybe the mentally sick). For some, the mean is violence, for others, the mean is conversations. We must learn to teach comnversations.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>I assume that from a very early age, everyboby wants to contribute. That is a radical assumption.</p>
 <p>I looked at Jean Piaget&rsquo;s &ldquo;<im>The Origins of Intellignce in Children</im>&rdquo;. It is a pretty old book, I was five when it was first published (I am 72 now).</div></p>
 <p>Its Sixth Stage, <div>The Invention of New Means Through Mental Combinations,</span> is significant, that is when as intelligence appears. This happens at about the age of 2. It is still childish reinvention, but you must pay attention./p>
 <p>It is at this stage that the child needs to also learn how to communicate it to their coomunity. Some parents do this brilliantly and most do it badly or not at all. <span name="bm01"><a href="">1</a></span>

 <h1></h1>
 <p>People who learn this learn, learn to communicate via stories. And stories are the core of communities.
