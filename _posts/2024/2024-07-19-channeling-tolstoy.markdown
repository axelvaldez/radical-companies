 <p>Leo (Lev) Tolstoy was not the typical Russian writer.</p>
</div>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Leo Tolstoy was a Russian writer and as such I avoided him for along time. I did not want anything to do with dark, pesimistic Russian novels, such as I had read growing up in Cuba.</p>
 <p>But Leo was different.</p>
 <p> Reading his <em>The Slavery of Our Times</em> made me feel like I had been channeling Tolstoy as I was writing about about the Radical system.</p>

<h1>Pacifist Lyof Nikolayevich</h1>
 <p>Tolstoy was a pacifist, but he could have been a Radical. Paficism is one of the many pointy things that stick out. But that is not the root of it. At the roort of it is the Radical system.</p>
 <p>In <em>Confession</em> he pretty much said that the (Orthodox) Christian system of his youth was close enough.</p>

<h1>Fiat Religions</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Zoroastrianism influenced Judaism.</li>
  <li>Judaism influenced Christianity.</li>
  <li>Christianity and Judaism influenced Islam.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>These systems, starting with Zoroastrianism, installed an all powerful boss god at the top and declared all other religions (systems) heathen. They became a separate systen,</p>

   <p>Systems are long-lasting, widespread and resilient. We can push back on them with effort, but over time, the system usually comes out ahead.</p>

 <p>The Internet, and the Large Language Models trained on it, says that Tolstoy declared himself a Christian. You can read the <em>Confession</em> book to verify it, but that is wrong. He did make it clear that he was a follower of the Christian new testament, but with a lot of caveats. He did created his own unique philosophy based upon the teachings of Jesus, whilke rejecting the institutional dogma of the Church.
