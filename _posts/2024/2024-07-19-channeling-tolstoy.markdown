 <p>Leo (Lev) Tolstoy was not the typical Russian writer.</p>
</div>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Leo Tolstoy was a Russian writer and as such I avoided him for along time. I did not want anything to do with dark, pesimistic Russian novels, such as I had read growing up in Cuba.</p>
 <p>But Leo was different.</p>
 <p> Reading his <em>The Slavery of Our Times</em> made me feel like I had been channeling Tolstoy as I was writing about about the Radical system.</p>

 <p>Once we see a system, we can change it.</p>

<h1>Pacifist Lyof Nikolayevich</h1>
 <p>Tolstoy was a pacifist, but he could have been a Radical. Paficism is one of the many pointy things that stick out. But that is not the root of it. At the roort of it is the Radical system.</p>
 <p>In <em>Confession</em> he pretty much said that the (Orthodox) Christian system of his youth was close enough.</p>

<h1>Fiat Religions</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Zoroastrianism influenced Judaism.</li>
  <li>Judaism influenced Christianity.</li>
  <li>Christianity and Judaism influenced Islam.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>These systems, starting with Zoroastrianism, installed an all powerful boss god at the top and declared all other religions (systems) heathen. They became a separate systen,</p>

   <p>Systems are long-lasting, widespread and resilient. We can push back on them with effort, but over time, the system usually comes out ahead.</p>

 <p>The Internet, and the Large Language Models trained on it, says that Tolstoy declared himself a Christian. You can read the <em>Confession</em> and <em>My Religion</em> books to verify it, but that is wrong. He did create his own unique philosophy based upon the teachings of Jesus, whilke rejecting the institutional dogma of the Church.</p>
 
 <h1>Violence</h1>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>&ldquo;<em>&hellip;we need not suppose a man&rsquo;s nature to be immutable, and all progress for ever impossible</em>.&rdquo;</p>
   <p id="_signature">Gkeat Baddow, Chelmsford, October 1900</p>
  </div>
  <p>To Tolstoy, &ldquo;<em>violence done by man to man is wrong</em>&rdquo; and we feel the same way. In fact, to us war, another form of violence, is wrong, too. In fact, any kind of man&rsquo;s violence whether to individuals, group, or nations is wrong.</p>
  <p>To Tolstoy is not that &ldquo;<em>people should be restrained from violence, but that <em>violence should become abhorrent</em>,&rdquo;</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You want to stop all wars?</li>
    <li>You want violence out of police action? teach its abhorrance!</li>
   </ul>
  <p>Teach its abhorrance!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em>Progress</em>,&rdquo; says Baddow, &ldquo;<em>in human well-being can only be achieved by relying more and more on reason and conscience, and less and less on man-made laws</em>.&rdquo;

  <h1>Centralization</h1>
   <p>Baddow says that Tolstoy &ldquo;<em>is dealing with the present problems on the plane of thoughts of the jurists and the economists</em>.&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>no one action,</em>&rdquo; says Baddow, &ldquo;<em>can be the next step for all men in all places</em>&rdquo;</p>
   <p>This is decentralization.</p>
