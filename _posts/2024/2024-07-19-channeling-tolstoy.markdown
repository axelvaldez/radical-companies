 <p>Leo (Lev) Tolstoy was not the typical Russian writer.</p>
</div>

<h1><Intro/h1>
 <p>Leo Tolstoy was a Russian writer and as such I avoided him for along time. I did not want anything to do with dark, pesimistic Russian novels, as I had read in Cuba. But Leo was different.</p>
 <p> Reading his <em>The Slavery of Our Times</em> made me feel like I had been channeling Tolstoy as I was writing about about the Radical model.</p>

<h1>Pacifist Lyof Nikolayevich</h1>
 <p>Tolstoy was a pacifist. But he could have been a Radical.</p>
 <p>Paficism emerges from a system as one of the many pointy things that stick out. In <em>Confession</em> he declared himself an Orthodox Christian system, but with lots of caveats.</p>

<h1>Fiat Religions</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Zoroastrinism influenced Judaism.</li>
  <li>Judaism influenced Christianity.</li>
  <li>Christianity and Judaism influnced Islam.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>These systems, starting with Zoroastrinis, installed an all powerful boss at the top, took us away from nature-based system, and declared all other religions (systems) heathen.</p>

<h1>The Internet</h1>
 <p>By the way, the Internet has it wrong and so are the Large Language Models being trained on it.</p>
 <p>The Internet says that Tolstoy declared a Christian. You can read his book, but that is not it at all. That is wrong.</p>
