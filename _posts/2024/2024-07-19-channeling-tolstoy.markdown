 <p>Leo (Lev) Tolstoy was not the typical Russian writer.</p>
</div>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Leo Tolstoy was a Russian writer and as such I avoided him for along time. I did not want anything to do with dark, pesimistic Russian novels, such as I had read growing up in Cuba.</p>
 <p>But Leo was different.</p>
 <p> Reading his <em>The Slavery of Our Times</em> made me feel like I had been channeling Tolstoy as I was writing about about the Radical system.</p>

 <p>Once we see a system, we can change it.</p>

<h1>Pacifist Lyof Nikolayevich</h1>
 <p>Tolstoy was a pacifist, but he could have been a Radical.</p>
 <p>Paficism emerges from a system as one of the many pointy things that stick out. But that is not the root of it. In <em>Confession</em> he pretty much said the (Orthodox) Christian system was close enough, but he addedd a lots of caveats.</p>

<h1>Fiat Religions</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Zoroastrinism influenced Judaism.</li>
  <li>Judaism influenced Christianity.</li>
  <li>Christianity and Judaism influenced Islam.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>These systems, starting with Zoroastrinism, installed an all powerful boss god at the top and declared all other religions (systems) heathen. In other words they became a separate systen,</p>

   <p>Systems are long-lasting, widespread and resilient. We can push back on them with effort, but over time, the system usually comes out ahead.</p>

<h1>The Internet</h1>
 <p>By the way, the Internet has it wrong (and so are the Large Language Models being trained on it).</p>
 <p>The Internet says that Tolstoy declared himself a Christian. You can read his book, but that is not it at all. That is wrong.</p>
