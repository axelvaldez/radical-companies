 <p>Leo (Lev) Tolstoy was not the typical Russian writer.</p>
</div>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Leo Tolstoy was a Russian writer and as such I avoided him for along time. I did not want anything to do with dark, pesimistic Russian novels, such as I had read growing up in Cuba.</p>
 <p>But Leo was different.</p>
 <p> Reading his <em>The Slavery of Our Times</em> made me feel like I had been channeling Tolstoy as I was writing about about the Radical system.</p>

 <p>Once we see a system, we can change it.</p>

<h1>Pacifist Lyof Nikolayevich</h1>
 <p>Tolstoy was a pacifist, but he could have been a Radical. Paficism is one of the many pointy things that stick out. But that is not the root of it. At the roort of it is the Radical system.</p>
 <p>In <em>Confession</em> he pretty much said that the (Orthodox) Christian system of his youth was close enough.</p>

<h1>Fiat Religions</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Zoroastrianism influenced Judaism.</li>
  <li>Judaism influenced Christianity.</li>
  <li>Christianity and Judaism influenced Islam.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>These systems, starting with Zoroastrianism, installed an all powerful boss god at the top and declared all other religions (systems) heathen. They became a separate systen,</p>

   <p>Systems are long-lasting, widespread and resilient. We can push back on them with effort, but over time, the system usually comes out ahead.</p>

 <p>The Internet, and the Large Language Models trained on it, says that Tolstoy declared himself a Christian. You can read the <em>Confession</em> and <em>My Religion</em> books to verify it, but that is wrong. He did create his own unique philosophy based upon the teachings of Jesus, whilke rejecting the institutional dogma of the Church.</p>
 
 <h1>Violence</h1>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>&ldquo;<em>&hellip;we need not suppose a man&rsquo;s nature to be immutable, and all progress forever impossible</em>&rdquo;</p>
   &hellip;
   <p>&ldquo;<em>Laws are made by goverment and eforced by physical violence</em>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To Tolstoy, &ldquo;<em>violence done by man to man is wrong</em>&rdquo; and we feel the same way; war, another form of violence, is wrong, too.</p>
  <p>All kinds of violence whether to individuals, group, or nations is wrong. To Tolstoy is not that &ldquo;<em>people should be restrained from violence, but that violence shuld become abhorrent.</em>t&rdquo; You want to stop all wars? teach its ahorrance! You want to do something like defund the police? teach its adhorance!
