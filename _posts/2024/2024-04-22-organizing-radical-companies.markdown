 <p>Once upon a time we described several Radical companies. This is another motivation.</p>
</div>

<h1>Motivation?</h1>
 <p>Once upon a time we imagined several Radical companies,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/12/rstayhome" target="_blank">rStayHome</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/13/rkare" target="_blank">rKare</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/14/rclean" target="_blank">rClean</a></li>
  </ul>
 <p>The new idea, suggested by Jose, is to make them franchises, but not Fiat Franchises. The Radical franchise would have no capital owners, instead the franchisor and the franchisees will be the same, and will be co-owners.</p>

 <h1>How It Starts</h1>
  <p>It all starts with loans.</p>
  <p>A small company does not start wth a lot of cash as capital. A koan would help,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The small company needs a web site and the help of a lawyer</li>
    <li>The web site normally costs $1,000: %750 for the website and $250 in profit: the $750 getsz paid immediately, the $250 becomes a loan to the small company owners</li>
    <li>The lawyeer has to set things up legally and for that his costs is $750, his profit is $1,000: the $500 is paid immediately, the $1,000 beomes a loan</li>
    <li>The new franchisee pays $200 every month into the loan fund</li>
     <ul>
      <li>The $200 get distributed according to the terms of the loan</li>
      <li>Alternatively, the loan gets paid relative to what is owed: $40 (20%) would go to the web page maker and $160 (80%) would go to the lawyer</li>
     </ul>
    <li>The loan may come directly from the service provider or from a fund created for that purpuse. This fund would be used also in case the small bussness fails financially and fainls to pay his loans</li>
    <li>The loan fund may be created by the service providers or by a grant</li>
   </ul>

<h1>The Franchise</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>The franchise itself will be an Ensemble of companies providing services the franchisees require (<em>e.g.</em>, purchasing, recycling, accounting, legal, etc).</li>
  <li>These services could have a transparent pricing or a paid for by a fund that would be distributed according to RADs.</li>
  <li>The fund itself would be a percentage of revenue (<em>i.e.</em>, it applies to everybody) or a Banner fund (<em>i.e.</em>, it applies to people who commit the yield of their pledged RADs).</li>
  <li>If a frachisee company is not generating enough of a fund, it may switched to a fund that the franchisees have to fund.</li>
 </ul>
