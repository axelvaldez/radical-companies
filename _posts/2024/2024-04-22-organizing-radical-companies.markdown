 <p>Once upon a time we described several Radical companies. This is another motivation.</p>
</div>

<h1>Motivation?</h1>
 <p>Once upon a time we imagined several Radical companies,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/12/rstayhome" target="_blank">rStayHome</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/13/rkare" target="_blank">rKare</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/14/rclean" target="_blank">rClean</a></li>
  </ul>
 <p>The new idea, suggested by Jose, is to make them franchises, but not Fiat Franchises. The Radical franchise would have no capital owners, instead the franchisor and the franchisees will be the same, and will be co-owners.</p>

 <h1>How It Starts</h1>
  <p>It all starts with loans. A small company does not start wth a lot of cash as capital, a loan is needed.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The small company needs a web site and the help of a lawyer</li>
    <li>The web site normally costs $1,000, %750 for the website and $250 in profit: the $750 gets paid immediately, the $250 becomes a loan to the small company owner</li>
    <li>The lawyer has to set things up legally and for that his costs is $750, his profit is $750: the $750 is paid immediately, the other $750 becomes a loan</li>
   </ul> 
  <p>The new franchisee pays $200 every month into the loan fund</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The $200 could get distributed according to the terms of the loan</li>
    <li>Alternatively, the loans gets paid relative to what is owed: 20% ($40) would go to the web page maker and 80% ($160) would go to the lawyer</li>
   </ul>
  <p>The loan fund,</p>  
   <ul>
    <li>Would be used in case the small bussiness fails to pay his loans</li>
    <li>May be created by the service providers, by a grant, or by pledged RADs</li>
   </ul>

<h1>The Franchise</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>The franchise itself will be an Ensemble of companies providing services the franchisees require (<em>e.g.</em>, purchasing, recycling, accounting, legal, etc).</li>
  <li>The fund itself would be a percentage of revenue (<em>i.e.</em>, it applies to everybody), The most likely scenario is a Banner fund (<em>i.e.</em>, it applies to people who commit the yield of their pledged RADs).</li>
  <li>If a frachisee company is not generating enough of a fund, it may switched to a fund that the franchisees have to fund.</li>
 </ul>
