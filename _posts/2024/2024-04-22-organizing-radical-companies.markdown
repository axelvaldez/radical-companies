 <p>Once upon a time we described several Radical companies. This is another motivation.</p>

<h1>Motivation?</h1>
 <p>Once upon a time we described several Radical companies,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/12/rstayhome">rStayHome</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/13/rkare">rKare</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/14/rclean">rClean</a></li>
  </ul>
 <p>The idea is to make them franchises, we hope that this acts as motivation. As opposed to the Fiat Franchise, the model we are used to, the Radical franchise would have no single owner: the franchisor and the franchisees will be the same.</p>

<h1>The Franchise</h1>
<ul>
 <li>The franchise itself will be an ensemble of companies providing whatever services the franchisees require. This would include purchasing, recycling, accounting, etc.</li>
 <li>These services would have a transparent pricing or a fund that would be distributed according to RADs.</li>
 <li>The fund itself would be a percentage of revenue (<em>i.e.</em>, it applies to everybody) or a Banner fund.</li>
 <li>If a frachisee company is not generating enough of a fund, it may become a fixed fund that the franchisees have to fund.</li>
</ul>
