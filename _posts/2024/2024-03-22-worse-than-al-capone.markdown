<h1>William the Conqueror</h1>
 <p>Everybody is trying to contribute, by violence or by conversations.</p>
 <p>We must learn to converse. British aristocracy are the original gangsters. The reason they own 75% of the British Island is because &ldquo;<em>they stole it by force.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<h1>William the Conqueror</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>William the Conqueror was worse than Al Capone. When he went to England from France, he grabbed hold of everything he could get his hands onto, and then he set up a system so that he and his friends got to hold onto it forever.</p>
  <p>Taxation. Education. The judiciary. It&rsquo;s all designed to help the aristocracy hold on to&hellip; land and &hellip; money.<a href="#en01"><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 </div>
 <p>And it holds until these days, &ldquo;&hellip; 160,000 families who own two-thirds of Great Britain and Ireland largely descend from the army of William the Conqueror &mdash; [since] 1066. &rdquo;<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

 <p>The is the system we call Fiat.</p>
