 <p>British aristocracy are the original gangsters. The reason they own 75% of the British Isles is because <span class="_standout; ">they stole it by force.</span></p>

<h1>William the Conqueror</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>William the Conqueror was worse than Al Capone. When he went to England from France, he grabbed everything he could get his hands on. Then he set up a system so that he and his friends got to hold onto it forever. Taxation. Education. The judiciary. It&rsquo;s all designed to help the aristocracy hold on to&hellip; land and &hellip; money.<a href="#en01"><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 </div>
 <p>And it holds until these days, <span class="_citation">&hellip; 160,000 families who own two-thirds of Great Britain and Ireland largely descend from the army of William the Conqueror &mdash; [since] 1066. &rdquo;<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>The Fiat system is based on that.</p>
