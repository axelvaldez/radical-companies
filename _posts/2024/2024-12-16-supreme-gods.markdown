 Supreme-God religions is the worst thing that could have happened.
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>The term <em>Supreme-God</em> <a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> refers to a hierarchical pattern that has lasted for quite a while, to thiosmday, in fact. Countries and businesses adopted the pattern and it has worked very well for them.</p>
 <p>This is a very brief review of of their latest paper.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>The paper brings up the rise of private armed forces. Bichler and  Nitzan take a dark view of it.</p>
 <p>They write that private armies will keep getting more and more powerful and this will lead to oligarchic states. This is a well researched paper and the data they analyzed certaily point to that conclusion.</p>
 <p>But the past is not a prediction of the future. Otherwise, we would still be vassals. Let&rsquo;s instead take their analysis as a warning.</p>
 <p>My own opinion is that private arm forces have been around forever. Reagan had them, Putin had them. A few politicians, like Trump, may have aspirations of creating a Hitler-like dictatorship, but right now I am not betting on it.</p>
