 Supreme-God religions are Fiat in that they are hierarchical. Installing a Supreme God is a pure centralization move.

<h1></h1>
 <p>The term <em>Supreme God</em> <a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> refers to a hierarchical pattern that has lasted for quite a while. To this day, in fact. Countries and businesses adopted the pattern and it has worked very well for them.</p>
 <p>This is a very brief review of of Bichler and Nitza latest paper.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>Their paper brings up the rise of private armed forces and they take a dark view of it, as we should all do. They write that private armies will keep getting more and more powerful and this will lead to oligarchic States. This is a well researched paper and the data they analyzed certaily points to that conclusion.</p>
 <p>But the past is not a prediction of the future. Let&rsquo;s instead take their analysis as a warning.</p>
 <p>Private armed forces have been around forever. For example, Reagan had them and Putin has them. A few politicians, say, Trump, may have aspirations of creating an authoritarian goveerment in the US, but right now I am not hoping/betting on it.</p>
