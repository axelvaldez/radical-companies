 Supreme-God religions is the worst thing that could have happened.
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>The term <em>Supreme-God</em> <a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> refers to a hierarchical pattern. And that is what has made them so long lasting. </p>
 <p>Countries and businesses adopted the pattern and it has worked very well for them.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>Another theme they bring up is that of private armies and paramilitry forces.</p>
 <p>Bichler and  Nitzan take a dark viewb of that. They write that private armies will take over and this will lead to oligarchic states (and with the recent Trump win, this is certainly a fear). This a well researched paper and the data certaily point to those conclusions.</p>
 <p>But that the past is not a prediction of the future. Let&rsquo;s take it as a warning of what we should not let happen.</p>
