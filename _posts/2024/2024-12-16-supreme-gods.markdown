 Supreme-God religions is the worst thing that could have happened.

<h1></h1>
 <p>The term <em>Supreme-God</em> <a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> refers to a hierarchical pattern. And that is what has made so long lasting.</p>
 <p>Countries and businesses adopted the pattern and it has worked very well for them.</p>
 <p>Bichler and  Nitzan take a much darker view. They write that private armies will take over and lead to oligarchy states.</p>
 <p>This came from data that certaily npoint to those conclusions. But that the past is not a prediction of the future. Maybe this only a well researched warning of what we should not allow to happen. Let's hope so.</p>
