 Supreme-God religions is the worst thing that could have happened.

<h1></h1>
 <p>The term <em>Supreme-God</em> <a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> refers to a hierarchical pattern. And that is what has made so long lasting.</p>
 <p>Countries and businesses adopted the pattern and it has worked very well for them.</p>
 <p>Bichler and  Nitzan take a much darker view. They write that private armies will take over. They analyzed the data and came out with those conclusions. Problem is that the past is not a prediction of the future. They may be right or they maybe wrong.</p>
