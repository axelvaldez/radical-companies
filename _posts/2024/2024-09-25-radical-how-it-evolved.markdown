<h1>In the Beginning</h1>
 <p>Something wanted to come out of us. Why did I make so much more money than the rest of them when we sold the Nearsoft, where in reality they had as big a hand in making the company grow?</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  &ldquo;<em>Well you did a lot of other things, too, for wealth. Other people did it for the paycheck</em>&rdquo;
 </div>
 <p>Questions kept going around in my head, and traditional answers sounded hollow. And it is not like I hate Fiat money or anything like that.</p>

<h1>Community</h1>
 <p>Later, Doug Kirkpatrick, self-management extraordinaire, introduced me to Jose and we started to have conversations, too.</p>
 <p>Adrian, Jose, and I ended up meeting once a week for about a year and an alternative system based on <em>contributions</em> started to take shape.</p>
 <p>We also started writing <em>Radical Companies</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW1HV3SK" target="_blank">Amazon</a>).</p>
 <p>We had checked with many people, including luminaries, but they did not have valuable or satisfactory answers, either.</p>

<h1>Fiat &amp; Radical</h1>
 <p>The system that we were working on we called Radical. No violence, no pumishing or killing the bad guys, no taking their properties, no revolution. It is simply an alternative.</p>

<h1>No Boss</h1>
 <p>There was the question of replacing the boss. I had experience with what came to be popularly known as self-management.</p>
 <p>However, we came to realize that companies do not have a self. Instead of self-management, we called it co-management. The team managed it together, no need for a boss.</p>

<h1>Recognized Contributions</h1>
 <p>Adrian Perez, co-author, and I, Matt Perez,experimented with how to recognize contributions. That was the one question that came up very often at Nearsoft. At the time of Nearsloft we did not have RADs, so we made it equal portions.</p>

<h1>Distributions</h1>
 <p>At Nearsoft we reserved part of our profits for the following year’s operations and the rest we distributed equally among everybody. If there were 100 people and we had a $100 to distribute each of us got a dollar.</p>

<h1>Money</h1>
 <p>I think the problem was money, in particular the equal distribution of money.</p>
 <p>If we had distributed carrots or potatoes it may not be a problem. Just eat them or give them away to friends and family. Money, on the other hand, is a universal mean of exchange. You can buy, for example, headphones with it. And that made it different.</p>
 <p>So for Radical we came up with RADs, without the baggage of money. You do something, other people recognize it as a contribution, and it results in RADs.</p>
 <p>Later we realized that <em>recognized contribution</em>&rdquo; was the key. If you have 10% of the RADs, you get 10% of the dividends or if you 200 RADs and I have 100, you get twice the benefits as I do.</p>
 <p>If you do not get what you think you deserve, you have to talk to other co-owners to learn why.</p>
 
<h1>RADs!</h1>
 <p>We made an app to do the math (RADs! free in Apple and Android stores).</h1>
 <p>And we also made the RADs public.</p>

<h1>Ownership, Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Fiat ownership is exclusive,</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  &ldquo;<em>I own it and you don&rsquo;t. Keep out of it!</em>&rdquo;
 </div>
 <p>That is OK for a toothbrush, but not for a business whose growth comes from the work that people put in it.</p>
 <p>Today Fiat ownership is invisible,</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  This is mine. I took it by force and I will keep it by force. Even if I had to kill you, everyone in your family, and burn everybody in your village.
 </div>

<h1>Fiat Ownership</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>We are blind to.</li>
  <li>We do not question it.</li>
  <li>We even defend it.</li>
  <li>We give it sole credit for whatever progress we have made.</li>
  <li>The ultimate goal of most people in the Fiat system is to get as much money (<em>i.e.</em>, coined power) as possible.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>We Are Blind to It</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Economists sometimes get really close to it, but at the last minute they go around it.</li>
  <li>Marx and his followers blame everything on ruthless capitalists, robber barons, and others bad people.</li>
  <li>Others blame our problems on our veering away from the path of indigenous people, you know, the simple people who were nostranger to slavery.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>It is incomprehensible that we don&lsquo;t see that Fiat ownership causes the majority of the harm we face, starting with poverty and excessive wealth.</p>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership is the kind of active property (<em>e.g.</em>, a company, not a house) that belongs to all who contributes to it. If recognize what youaredoing as a contribution and give you RADs for it, then you are a co-owner.</p>
 <p>There can be other ways to do it, but it has to come from a real contribution because. Remember,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There are no bosses to kiss up to</li>
    <li>Capital does not constitute a contribution.</li>
    <li>If the RADs given do not makes sense to yoiu, yu have the and responsibility to ask.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Co-Ownership?</h1>
 <p>Many questions came up with co-ownership and we worked out many of them. I say most of them because we have our blind spots, too, but others will bring up other shortcomings up later. Many will have to be worked out over time.</p>
 <p>Just be sure not to fall back on Fiat.</p>

<h1>Co-Management, &amp; Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Co-management has gone by &ldquo;<em>self-management</em>&rdquo; except a business has no self. So, we changed the name to co-management, because people, self included, can work without a boss.</p>
 <p>Note that co-management is not a flat organization or a patriarchy, or even a co-op.</p>

<h1>Capital or Contribution</h1>
 <p>Many people can make a contribution, though capital can come from, a bank, individuals, or even from a <em>Venture Capital firm</em>.</p>
 <p>Then we would sign a note saying that,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>We will return the principal</li>
   <li>Plus a fixed percentage, or a percentage of revenue, or any other scheme</li>
   <li>A Radical Investment is never exchanged for power. You are free to do it, but it will very likely turn into a Fiat investment, with a board, etc.</li>
   <li>And, of course, if the investment does not work out, that is that as far as the Radical Investment, just like any other investment.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo; in this case refers to all co-owners. Maybe it can be done with a contract and multiple signatures, but we need to find a mechanism for all, or maybe a majority, of co-owners to commit.</p>

<h1>The RADs Mobile App</h1>
 <p>The RADs! mobile app has continued to evolve a lot. We have added a lot of things, taken off other things, and resolved a whole lot of issues.</p>
 <p>For example, as the name suggest we tried to let co-owners give RADs directly, but that did work so well. So we switched to recognizing contributions. The result is converted to RADs and can then be made tangible.</p>

<h1>RADs App&hellip;</h1>
 <p>The RADs app is open to changes as you and us find mistakes and better solutions.</p>

<h1>No Dogma</h1>
 <p>There is nothing dogmatic here. Radical is only an alternative to Fiat. You are welcome to add things and change things, so long as it does not end up going back into the Fiat system.</p>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>These are the blocks of the Foundation,</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <img
    src='/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation.svg'
    width='70%'
    alt="The Foundation table consist of pairs. People: [meaning & belonging].
    The other is for [comunnities: decentralization & transparency]].
    And the lat Foundation block is for [practices: experimentation.]"
    title="">
  </div>
 <p>But you are not going to get a demerit or a medal if you do not follow it, but if you are not careful you will have wasted time and end up back in the Fiat system.</p>
 <p>If it is working for all co-owners, go with. It is not, find another solution.</p>
