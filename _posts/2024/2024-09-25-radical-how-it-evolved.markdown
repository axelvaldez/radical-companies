<h1>In the Beginning</h1>
 <p>Something wanted to come out of us. Why did I make so much more money from the sale of the company than others. I I may have deserved some credit for getting it started, but everybody in the company contributed to its growth!</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  &ldquo;<em>Well you did a lot of other things, too, for wealth. Other people did it for the paycheck</em>&rdquo;
 </div>
 <p>Questions like these kept going around in my head, and traditional answers sounded hollow. BTW, I do not hate Fiat money or anything like that.</p>

<h1>Community</h1>
 <p>Later, Doug Kirkpatrick, self-management extraordinaire, introduced me to Jose and we started to have conversations, too. Adrian, Jose, and I ended up meeting once a week for about a year and an alternative system based on <em>contributions</em> started to take shape.</p>
 <p>We also started writing <em>Radical Companies</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW1HV3SK" target="_blank">Amazon</a>).</p>
 <p>We had checked with many people, including luminaries, but they did not have valuable or satisfactory answers, either.</p>

<h1>Fiat &amp; Radical</h1>
 <p>The alternative we were working on we called <em>Radical</em>. No violence, no punishing or killing the bad guys, no no revolution. Radical was simply an alternative.</p>

<h1>No Boss</h1>
 <p>There was the question of replacing or eliminating the boss. And I happened to have experience with that.</p>
 <p>However, we came to realize that companies do not have a selfnand instead of self-management, we called it co-management. The team managed to work together without a boss.</p>

<h1>Recognized Contributions</h1>
 <p>Co-author Adrian Perez and I experimented with how to recognize contributions.We knew wehad to be careful because that was the one question that came up often at Nearsoft. At the time we had not come up with RADs and the distributions were all equal.</p>

<h1>Distributions</h1>
 <p>At Nearsoft we reserved part of our profits for the following year&lsquo;s operations and sice we jhad not come up with RADs we distributed what was left equally among everybody. If there were 100 people, if we had a $100 to distribute each of us got one dollar.</p>

<h1>Money</h1>
 <p>I think the problem was the equal distribution of money.</p>
 <p>If we had distributed carrots or potatoes it may not be a problem. Just eat them or give them away to friends and family. Money, on the other hand, is a universal mean of exchange. You can buy, for example, headphones with it.</p>
 <p>So for Radical we came up with RADs, without the baggage of money. You do something, other people recognize it as a contribution, recognize them, and the results was RADs.</p>
 <p>Later we realized that <em>recognized contribution</em>&rdquo; was the key. If you have 10% of the RADs, you get 10% of the dividends; if you 200 RADs and I have 100, you get twice what I do.</p>
 <p>If you do not get what you think you deserve, you will have to talk to other co-owners to learn why.</p>
 <p>The co-owners can decide whether to make accessible to the public, too. In the spirint of Transparecyb, our strong reecomendation is to always do so.</p>
 
<h1><em>RADs!</em></h1>
 <p>We made an app to do the math (free in Apple and Android stores). And we also made the RADs public.</p>

<h1>Ownership &amp; Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Fiat ownership is exclusive,</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  <em>This is mine. I keep it by force, even if I had to kill you, everyone in your family, or burn everybody in your village.</em>>
 </div>
 <p>That is OK for a toothbrush, but not for a business whose growth comes from the work that many people put in it.</p>

<h1>Fiat Ownership</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>We are blind to it.</li>
  <li>We do not question it.</li>
  <li>We even <em>defend</em> it.</li>
  <li>We give it sole credit for whatever progress we make.</li>
  <li>The ultimate goal of most people in the Fiat system is to get as much money and power as possible.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>We Are Blind to It</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Economists sometimes get really close to it, but they go around it.</li>
  <li>Marx and his followers blame everything on ruthless capitalists, robber barons, and others <em>bad</em> people.</li>
  <li>Others blame our problems on our veering away from the path of indigenous people, you know, the simple people who were no stranger to slavery.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>It is incomprehensible that we don&lsquo;t see that Fiat ownership causes the majority of the harm we face, starting with poverty and ending excessive wealth.</p>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership is the kind of active property (<em>e.g.</em>, a company) that belongs to all who contributes to it. If I recognize what you are doing as a contribution, then you are a co-owner.</p>
 <p>Co-ownership comes from a Radical Investment because,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There are no bosses to kiss up to.</li>
    <li>Capital does not constitute a contribution. At bet it is temporary.</li>
    <li>If the RADs given do not makes sense to you, you have the responsibility to have the people involved explain it to you.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Many questions came up with co-ownership and we worked out many of them. Mot that We have blind spots, too. Others will bring up shortcomings up later and will have to be worked out over time.</p>

<h1>Co-Management &amp; Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Co-management has gone by the name &ldquo;<em>self-management</em>&rdquo;.</p>
 <p>Except a business has no self.</p>
 <p>We changed the name to co-management because people can make decisions and work without a boss.</p>
 <p>Note that co-management is not a flat organization or a patriarchy, or even a co-op.</p>

<h1>Capital &amp; Contribution</h1>
 <p>Many people can make a contribution.</p>
 <p>Capital may come as a radical Investment from a bank, individuals, or even from a Venture Capital firm as a Radical Investment with a not attached to it,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>We will return the principal.</li>
   <li>Plus a fixed percentage, or a percentage of revenue, or any other scheme.</li>
   <li>A Radical Investment is never exchanged for power. You are free to do it, but it will very likely turn into a Fiat investment, with a board, etc.</li>
   <li>If the investment does not work out and we can not do any of the things above, then we can not and that is that as far as the Radical Investment goes, just like any other investment.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo; in this case refers to all co-owners. Maybe it can be done with a contract and multiple signatures, but we need to find a mechanism for all of co-owners to commit.</p>

<h1>The <em>RADs!</em> Mobile App</h1>
 <p>The <em>RADs!</em> mobile app continues to evolve. We have added a lot of things, taken off other things, and resolved a whole lot of issues.</p>
 <p>For example, we tried to let co-owners give RADsÂ directly, but that did work so well. So we switched to recognizing contributions. The result is converted to RADs and made tangible.</p>

<h1>No Dogma</h1>
 <p>There is nothing dogmatic here. we visualize Radical as an alternative to Fiat.</p>
 <p>You are welcome to add things and change things. Just be careful not toend up back into Fiat mode. If you do, there is no shame in course-correcting and do it better the next time.</p>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>These are the blocks of the Foundation,</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <img
    src='/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation.svg'
    width='70%'
    alt="The Foundation table consist of pairs. People: [meaning & belonging].
    The other is for [comunnities: decentralization & transparency].
    And the lat Foundation block is for [practices: experimentation.]">
  </div>
 <p>You are not going to get a demerit or a medal if you do not follow it, but if you are not careful you may end up back in the Fiat system.</p>
 <p>In general, if it works for all co-owners, go with it. Else, find another solution.</p>

<h1>Banners </h1>
 <p>Banners came up s we realized that we need a way to respresent non-people in RADs. Actually, the fisrt name that ocurred to use was Totem, but then Adrian pointed out that &lsquo;<em>totem</em>&rsquo; was a religiosus symbol and we should not. After some thinking, we switched to Banners.</p>
 <p>Among other things, Banners could represent things like compromises amd commitments and for how long.</p>

<h1>Public Dashboards</h1>
 <p>All RADs transactions are made public via Public Dasbpoards to all co-owners,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>They display <em>how many RADs</em> moved between people and the people involved and for what reasons.</li>
   <li>In the case of people-to-Banners, they include <em>how many RADs or money</em> have been committed and <em>for how long</em>.</li>
  </ul>
