 <p>Fiat is the name we have given the system we live in today. It is based on capital and competition. Corp, LLC, LLP, etc., they are all Fiat owned by one or a few people.</p>
 <p>Radical is an alternative to it.</p>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Fiat is our name for the system we live in today. It is based on capital and competition. Corp, LLC, LLP, etc., all Fiat, are all owned by one or a few people and their job is to create more capital for the owner(s). Radical is an alternative to it, based on contributions and collaboration, not capital and competition.</p>
 <p>The Radical systems, we believe, is the next stage of development for businesses. It is not a &lsquo;fix&rsquo; to the Fiat system. It will bring about an economic transformation for companies through truly engaged people.</p>
 <p>Fiat has grown with us, so it feels natural. Radical is something that we have to grow conciously, like pioneers. Like Johnny Appleseed, only instead of apples all over the US we re going to &lsquo;plant&rsquo; Radicals systems all over the world.</p>

<h1>Collaboration</h1>
 <p>To make the business transformation happen, first the people have to transform from competitors to collaborators and manage and own companies that way.</p>
 <p>Collaboration does not come naturally because we have been born and grown up in the Fiat system, and so did our parents and grandparents.
 <p>We all, and children most of all, learn what we live, whether is for the worse&hellip;</p>

 <p style="margin-top:6px; ">We are driven by the desire to collaborate and we want to make an impact, as it happens when people help each other after a tornado or an earthquake.</p>

 <h1>Impact</h1>
 <p>The Fiat system blocks us from collaborating at work. It only let us do whatever the boss thinks will &lsquo;grow his capital&rsquo;.</p>
 <p>The Radical system allows you to make an impact based on collaboration and openess. The Fiat system pushes us towards competition and secrecy. It blocks us from making an impact other than to &lsquo;grow his capital&rsquo;.</p>
 <p>At Fiat workplaces we exchange our autonomy for money and do what the boss says to do and how to do it. Follow the rules. Stay in your silo. Keep doing it the way the boss said, even if we know how to do it for less cost and effort. He wants you to do it his way.</p>
 <p>This makes innovation impossible; it makes people disengage. Just keep doing what the boss expects you to do until it is time to leave.<p>

<h1>Companies</h1>
 <p>Co-management has momentum behind it. But co-management is not enough, it needs co-ownership.</p>
 <p>Co-management by itself is fragile. The minute the benevolent boss leaves the stage, it is more than likely that the system will go back to the Fiat ways. On the other hand, when everybody is a co-owner the company will likely remain Radical.</p>
 <p>In any case, this is going to quite possibly take a long time, but it will happen.</p>
 <p>By the way, the word <em>company</em> comes from Latin <em>com-</em> (thogether) and <em>pan</em> (bread, food>), meaning <em>people who break bread together</em>.</p>

  <p>As palatial rankings solidified, so did the pantheon of gods. Violence within and military conquests between states were  accompanied by mergers and acquisitions among their deities. Consolidating hierarchies gave raise to <em>supreme gods</em>, thirsty for blood and eager for war. The gods climbed to the skies, severed their direct relation with their worshippers, and grew evermore mysterious and difficult to understand. A hierarchy of intermediaries&mdash;read, organized church&mdash;was now responsible for representing and interpreting them.</p>

<h1>RADs</h1>
 <p>RADs are the key to making this work.</p>
 <p>RADs are unitless tokens that can factor anything through them. If you have twice as many RADs as me, you get twice as much (<em>e.g.</em>, money) as me.</p>
 <p>Maybe a system, based on capital and distributed through shares was all that could be done in the past. But we are in the 21<sup>th</sup> century now. We carry super computers in our pockets and we can connect with anybody in the world through the Internet.</p>
 <p>With a telephone app, we can recognize contributions and give people RADs anywhere in the wold. Most importantly, such an app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rads/id6447589527" target="_blank">RADs! mobile app</a>) allows us to do this directly, connect with one another, and skip the boss altogether.</p>
