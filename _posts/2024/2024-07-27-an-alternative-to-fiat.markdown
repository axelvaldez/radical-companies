 <p>Fiat is the name we have given the system we live in today. It is based on capital and competition. Corp, LLC, LLP, etc., they are all Fiat owned by one or a few people.</p>
 <p>Radical is an alternative to it.</p>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Fiat is our name for the system we live in today. It is based on capital and competition and anythingnelse it takes to <em>win</em>. Corp, LLC, LLP, etc. are all owned by one or a few people and their job is to create more capital for themselves. Radical is an alternative to it, based on contributions and collaboration, not capital and competition.</p>
 <p>The Radical systems, we believe, is the next stage of development for businesses. It is not a &lsquo;fix&rsquo; to the Fiat system, it isan alternative. It brings about an economic transformation for companies.</p>
 <p>Fiat has grown with us, so it feels natural. Radical is something that we have to grow conciously, like pioneers. Like Johnny Appleseed, only instead of apples all over the US we re going to &lsquo;plant&rsquo; Radical systems all over the world.</p>

<h1>Collaboration</h1>
 <p>To make the business transformation happen, first the people have to transform from competitors to collaborators and manage and own companies that way.</p>
 <p>Collaboration does not come naturally because we have been born and grown up in the Fiat system, and so did our parents and grandparents, where the aim is to win, win, win.
 <p>We all learn what we live, whether is for the worse&hellip;</p>

 <h1>Impact</h1>
  <p>The Fiat system blocks us from collaborating at work. It only let us do whatever the boss thinks will &lsquo;grow his capital&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>The Radical system allows you to make an impact based on collaboration and openess. The Fiat system pushes us towards competition and secrecy. It blocks us from making an impact other than to &lsquo;grow his capital&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>At Fiat workplaces we exchange our autonomy for money and do what the boss says to do and how to do it. Follow the rules. Stay in your silo. Keep doing it the way the boss said, even if we know how to do it for less cost and effort. He wants you to do it his way.</p>
  <p>This makes innovation impossible beecause it makes people disengage and keep doing what the boss expects you to do until it is time to leave.<p>

<h1>Companies</h1>
 <p>Co-management is not enough, it needs co-ownership for the long term. Co-management by itself is fragile: the minute the benevolent boss leaves the stage, it is more than likely that the system will reverts to Fiat. On the other hand, when everybody is a co-owner the company will likely remain Radical. This may take a long time, but it will happen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As palatial rankings solidified, so did the pantheon of gods. Violence within and military conquests between states were  accompanied by mergers and acquisitions among their deities. Consolidating hierarchies gave raise to <em>supreme gods</em>, thirsty for blood and eager for war. The gods climbed to the skies, severed their direct relation with their worshippers, and grew evermore mysterious and difficult to understand. A hierarchy of intermediaries (read, organized church) was responsible for interpreting them.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>RADs</h1>
 <p>RADs are key to making this work in the 21<sup>th</sup> century. They are tokens that can factor anything through them; RADs owned by individuals are a percentage ofnall the RADs in existance. If you have twice as many RADs as me, you get twice as much (<em>e.g.</em>, money) as me.</p>
 <p>Maybe shares was all that could be done in the past. But we are in the 21<sup>th</sup> century now,</p>
