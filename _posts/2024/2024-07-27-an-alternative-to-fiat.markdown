 <p>Fiat is the name we have given the system we live in today. It is based on capital and competition. Corp, LLC, LLP, etc., they are all Fiat owned by one or a few people.</p>
 <p>Radical is an alternative to it.</p>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Fiat is our name for the system we live in today. It is based on capital and competition. Corp, LLC, LLP, etc., all Fiat, are all owned by one or a few people and their job is to create more capital for the owner(s). Radical is an alternative to it, based on contributions and collaboration, not capital and competition.</p>
 <p>The Radical systems, we believe, is the next stage of development for businesses. It is not a &lsquo;fix&rsquo; to the Fiat system. It will bring about an economic transformation for companies through truly engaged people.</p>
 <p>Fiat has grown with us, so it feels natural. Radical is something that we have to grow conciously, like pioneers. Like Johnny Appleseed, only instead of apples all over the US we re going to &lsquo;plant&rsquo; Radicals systems all over the world.</p>

<h1>Collaboration</h1>
 <p>To make the business transformation happen, first the people have to transform from competitors to collaborators and manage and own companies that way.</p>
 <p>Collaboration does not come naturally because we have been born and grown up in the Fiat system, and so did our parents and grandparents.
 <p>We all, and children most of all, learn what we live, whether is for the worse&hellip;</p>

   <p>If a child lives with criticism, he learns to condem</p>
   <p>If a child lives with hostility, he learns to fight</p>
   <p>If a child lives with ridicule, he learns to be shy</p>
   <p>If a child lives with shame, he learns to feel guilty</p>

 <p>&hellip; or for the better,</p>
  <div class="_citation" style="font-size:10px; ">
   <p>If a child lives with tolerance, he learnss to be patient</p>
   <p>If a child lives with encouragement, he learns to be confident</p>
   <p>If a child lives with praise, he learns to appreciate</p>
   <p>If a child lives with fairness, he learns to justice</p>
   <p>If a child lives with security, he learns to have faith</p>
   <p>If a child lives with approval, he learns to like himself</p>
   <p>If a child lives with acceptance and frienship, he learns to find love in the world</p>

 <p style="margin-top:6px; ">We are driven by the desire to collaborate and we want to make an impact. For example, watch how people collaborate and help each other after a tornado or an earthquake.</p>

 <h1>Impact</h1>
 <p>The Fiat system blocks us from collaborating at work and only let us do whatever the boss thinks will grow the capital of the Fiat owner(s).</p>
 <p>The Radical system allows you to make an impact based on collaboration and openess. The Fiat system pushes us towards competition and secrecy. It blocks us from maing an impact other than to make money.</p>
 <p>At Fiat workplaces we give up our autonomy for money and instead do what the boss says to do and how to do it. Follow the rules. Stay in your silo. Keep doing it the way the boss said to do it, even if we know how to do it for less cost and effort.</p>
 <p>This makes innovation impossible and it makes people disengage. Just keep doing your work until it is time to leave.<p>

<h1>Companies</h1>
 <p>Co-management has momentum behind it. But co-management is not enough.</p>
 <p>It needs co-ownership.</p>
 <p>Co-management by itself is fragile. The minute the benevolent boss leaves the stage it is more than likely that the system will go back to the Fiat system. On the other hand, when everybody is a co-owner, the company will remain Radical.</p>
 <p>In any case, this is going to be difficult and quite possibly take a long time, but it will happen.</p>

<h1>RADs</h1>
 <p>RADs are the key to making this work.</p>
 <p>RADs are unitless tokens that can factor anything, including money. If you have twice as many RADs as me, you get twice as much, say, money as me.</p>
 <p>Maybe a system, based on capital tokens (shares), was all that could be done in the past. But we are in the 21<sup>th</sup> century now. We carry super computers in our pockets and we can connect with anybody in the world through the Internet.</p>
 <p>With a telephone app, we can recognize contributions and give people RADs anywhere in the wold. Most importantly, such an app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rads/id6447589527" target="_blank">RADs!</a>) will allow us to do this directly and connect with one another and skip the boss altogether.</p>
