 <p>Fiat is our name for the system we live in today. It is based on capital investments and competition. Corp, LLC, LLP, etc., they are all Fiat. Radical is an alternative to it.</p>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Fiat is our name for the system we live in today. It is based on capital and competition and anything else it takes to <em>win</em>. Corp, LLC, LLP, etc. are all owned by one or a few people and their job is to create more capital for themselves. Radical is an alternative to it, based on personal contributions and collaboration, not capital and competition.</p>
 <p>The Radical systems, we believe, is the next stage of development for businesses to become companinies. It is not a <span class="_standout">fix</span> to the Fiat system, it is an alternative.</p>
 <p>It brings about an economic transformation for companies.</p>
 <p>We have grown with Fiat, so it is invisible and it feels <span class="_standout"">natural</span>. Radical is something that we had to put together conciously.</p>

<h1>Collaboration</h1>
 <p>To make the business transformation happen, first the people have to transform their minds and habits from competitors to collaborators.</p>
 <p>Collaboration does not come naturally because we have been born and grown up in the Fiat system, and so did our parents and grandparents, where the aim is to win, win, win. We all learn what we live, even if for the worse&hellip;</p>

 <p style="margin-top:6px; ">We are driven by the desire to collaborate, like after a tornado or an earthquake.</p>

 <h1>Impact</h1>
  <p>The Fiat system blocks us from collaborating at work. It only let us do whatever the boss thinks will <span class="_standout">grow his capital</span>.</p>
  <p>The Radical system allows you to make an impact based on collaboration and openess. The Fiat system pushes us towards competition and secrecy. It blocks us from making an impact other than to &lsquo;grow his capital&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>At Fiat workplaces we exchange our autonomy for wage-money and do what the boss says to do. <span class="_standout">Follow the rules. Keep doing it the way the boss said, even if we know how to do it for less cost and effort. He wants you to do it his way.</span></p>
  <p>This makes innovation impossible and it makes people disengaged, so keep doing what the boss expects you until it is time to go home.<p>

<h1>Businesses vs Companies</h1>
 <p>Co-management is not enough, it needs co-ownership for the long term. Co-management by itself is fragile: the minute the benevolent boss leaves the stage, it is more than likely that the system will reverts to some form of Fiat. On the other hand, when everybody is a co-owner the company it will likely remain Radical.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As palatial rankings solidified, so did the pantheon of gods. Violence within and military conquests between states were  accompanied by mergers and acquisitions among their deities. Consolidating hierarchies gave raise to <em>supreme gods</em>, thirsty for blood and eager for war. The gods climbed to the skies, severed their direct relation with their worshippers, and grew evermore mysterious and difficult to understand. A hierarchy of intermediaries (read, organized church) was responsible for interpreting them.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>RADs</h1>
 <p>RADs are key to making this work in the 21<sup>th</sup> Century. They can factor anything through them. If you have twice as many RADs as me, you get twice as much as me (<em>e.g.</em>, money).</p>
 <p>Maybe shares was all that could be done in the past, but not now,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>We carry super-computers in our pockets</li>
   <li>We can connect with anybody in the world through the Internet.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>With a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rads/id6447589527" target="_blank">RADs! mobile app</a> we can recognize contributions and give people RADs anywhere in the world. And most importantly: no need for a boss to do this.</p>
