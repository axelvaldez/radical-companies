<h1>Intro</h1> 
 <p>Fiat is our name for the system we live in today, based on violence and on capital. Radical is an alternatibe to it, based on collaboration and contributions.</p>
 <p>A Radical id the next stage of development formus and our society. We believe that it will bring about an economic transformation.</p>

 <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>The need for a Radical alternative is based on hiow we view ourselves and our purpose. We want to collaborate but the Fiat system does not let us, it pushes us towards violence. One example though our work where we exchqnge our times and out abilities to do whqt the boss say. Where we have to follow the rules and stay in our silos, even if we know how to do it better and for less cost.</p>
  <p>aTo mmake that happen people have to transform and then teams help people trandform.</p>

 <h2>Collaboration</h2>
  <p>The need for a radical transformation in how we view nature, ourselves, and our purpose, driven by the desire to collaborate and make a collective impact.</p>

 <h2>Transformatiom</h2>
  <p>Necessary changes in society and the economy to empower people and communities.</p>

 <h2>Companies</h2>
