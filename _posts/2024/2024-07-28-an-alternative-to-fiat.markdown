<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Fiat is our name for the system we live in today, based on capital and competition. Corp, LLC, LLp, etc., they are all owned by one or a few people.</p>
 <p>Radical is an alternatibe to it, based on contributions and collaboration, not on capital and competition.</p>
 <p>The Radical systems is the next stage of development for business. It will bring about an economic transformation.</p>
  
<h1>Competition Is Business Hostile</h1>
 <p>To make the business transformation happen, first the people have to transform from competitors to collaborators.</p>

<h1>Collaboration</h1>
 <p>Colaboration is key to a radical company. It does not come naturally because we have been born and grown up in the Fiat system. And so did our parents and our grandparents and all that came before them</p>
 <p>We are driven by the desire to collaborate. Just watch little kids. We are also driven to make a significant impact. The Fiat system moves us away from what we want.</p>

<h1>Impact</h1>
 <p>The Radical system allows to make an impact.</p>
 <p>The Fiat system pushes us towards competition and secrecy.</p>
 <p>At Fiat workplace we exchange our autonomy and do what the boss says to do and how to do it.</p>
 <p>Follow the rules. Stay in your silo. And keep doing it the way the boss said to do it, even if we know how to do it for less cost and effort. This eliminates innovation and it makes people disengage. Jusatnkeep doing iuntil itismtimeto leave.<p>

<h1>Companies</h1>
 <p>Co-management has momentum behind it. But it is not enough. It needs co-ownership.</p>
 <p>Co-management by itself is fragile. The minute the benevolent boss leaves the stage it is more than likely that the system will go back to the Fiat system. On the other hand, when everybody is a co-owner, the company will remain Radical.</p>

<h1>RADs</h1>
 <p>Maybe the Fiat system was what could be done in the past. But we are in the 21<sup>th</sup> century now. We carry super computers in our pockets and we can connect with anybody in the world through the Internet. With groups or one-on-one.</p>
 <p>With RADs we can recognize contributions and based on that give people RADs, unitless tokens that can factor anything, including money. If you have twice as many RADs as me you get twice what I get.</p>
 <p>People can give these rewards directly, not through a boss. We can do that now.</p>
