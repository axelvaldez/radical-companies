<h1>Intro</h1> 
 <p>Fiat is our name for the system we live in today, based on violence and on capital. Radical is an alternatibe to it, based on collaboration and contributions.</p>
 <p>A Radical id the next stage of development formus and our society. We believe that it will bring about an economic transformation.</p>

 <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>The need for a Radical alternative is based on hiow we view ourselves and our purpose, our impact,and our missions.</p>
  <p>We,people, want to collaborate but the Fiat system gets in the way as it pushes us towards violence, from the very minor to the most ferocious. For example, at our work we exchange, our times. and our autonomy to do what the boss says. We have to follow the rules.We have stay in our silos, even if we know how to do it for less cost. competition ismbusiness hostile.</p>
  <p>To make the transformation happen the teams must help people to trasform from competition to collaboration. From being an employee to being a co-owner.</p>

 <h2>Collaboration</h2>
  <p>A Radical transformation id in line with how we view nature, driven by the desire to collaborate and make a significant impact.</p>

 <h2>Transformatiom</h2>
  <p>As I said above, tenfirst step is to being open to the transformatonto to a Radical system, and away from a fiat system.</p>

 <h2>Companies</h2>
  <p>We believe that Fiat <em>businesses</em> will be the incubators of Radical <em>companies</em>. Co-management is already in motion, but it needs co-ownership to be fully complete. The problem woth co-management by itself is that the minute the boss leaves the stage it is more that likely that the system will go back to Fiat. On the other hand when everybody is a co-owner it is very likely that the compoany will remain Radical.</p>
  <p>Colaboration is key to a radical company. It does not come naturally because we have been born and grown up in the Fiat system. And so did our parents and our grandparents and all that came before them</p>
