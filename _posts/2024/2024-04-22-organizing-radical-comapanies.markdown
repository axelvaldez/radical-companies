<h1>Motivation?</h1>
 <p>Once upon a time we described several Radical companies. We hope that this acts as motivation.</p>
 <p>The idea is to make them franchises. As opposed to the Fiat Franchise, the model we are used to, the Radical franchise would have the franchisor be the franchisees.</p>

<h1>The Franchise</h1>
<ul>
 <li>The franchise itself will be an ensemble of companies providing whatever services the franchisees require. This would include purchasing, recycling, accounting, etc.</li>
 <li>These services would have a transparent pricing or a fund that would be distributed according to RADs.</li>
 <li>The fund itself would be a percentage of revenue (<em>i.e.</em>, it applies to everybody) or a Banner fund.</li>
 <li>If a frachisee company is not generating enough of a fund, it may become a fixed fund that the franchisees have to fund.</li>
</ul>
