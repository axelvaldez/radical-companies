<div style='display:none; '>
 <p>There are many forms of investments that we had not thought of. Jose just came up with another..</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
<p>Instead of one-on-one, investments could be done with one person representing others. We think that a maximum of 10 is enough, but experiemtn. The number 10 is to make it possinle for a Radical Investee to still have direct discussons with the Radical Investor. That is nouer number, experiment and come up with your own.</p>
<p>But we think that 10 or less is going to be most fit to the task, in particular for the Investee tohave face-=face discussions with the imvestors.\, as agroup or one-on-one.</p>
