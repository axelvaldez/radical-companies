<div style='display:none; '>
 <p>There are many forms of investments that we had not thought of. Jose just came up with another..</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>Instead of one-on-one, investments could be done with one person representing others, not as an intermediary, but as a point of contact. We think that a maximum of 10 Radical Investors is enough. The number 10 makes it possible for a Radical Investee to still have direct discussions with the Radical Investors, as a group or one-on-one.</p>
 <p>If a Radical Investor is talking only to the intermediary, that may be a form of Fiat behavior. All Radical Investors must be on the lookout for Fiat Creep.</p>
 <p>BTW. 10 is just a number. If it doesn&rsquo;t work for you, experiment and come up with a number that does.</p>
