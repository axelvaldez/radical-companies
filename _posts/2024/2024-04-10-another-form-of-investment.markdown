<div style='display:none; '>
 <p>There are many forms of investments that we had not thought of. Jose just came up with another..</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
<p>Instead of one-on-one, investments could be done with one person representing others. We think that a maximum of 10 is enough, but experiment. The number 10 makes possinle for a Radical Investee to still have direct discussons with the Radical Investors.</p>
<p>This, 10, is ust a number. If you don not agree, experiment and come up with your a number tat works for hour community. But we think that 10 or less is going to be most fit to the task, in particular for the Radical Investee to have face-to-face discussions with the Radica Imvestors, as agroup or one-on-one.</p>
