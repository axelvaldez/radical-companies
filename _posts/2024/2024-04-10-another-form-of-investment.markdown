<div style='display:none; '>
 <p>There are many forms of investments that we had not thought of. Jose just came up with another..</p>
</div>

<h1>Investments</h1>
 <p>Instead of one-on-one, investments could be done with one person representing others, not as an intermediary, but as a point of contact.</p>
 <p>For example, a maximum of 10 Radical Investors is enough. The number 10 makes it possible for a Radical Investee to still have direct discussions with the Radical Investors, as a group or one-on-one. If a Radical Investor is talking only to the intermediary, beware that may be a form of Fiat behavior.</p>
 <p>This is the responsibility of all investors, not just the point of contact or the entrepreneur.</p>
