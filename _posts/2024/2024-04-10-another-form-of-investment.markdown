 <p>There are many forms of investments that we had not thought of. We just came up with another.</p>
</div>

<h1>Investments</h1>
 <p>Instead of one-on-one, investments could be done with one person representing others, say 10, as a point of contact.</p>
 <p>A small group makes it possible for a Radical Invest<em>ee</em> to still have direct discussions with the Radical Invest<em>ors.</em></p>
 <p>You dont have to meet with all investors at once, it could beanynmber of tye. But if you are talking only to the same one, it may a Fiat habit creeping in. This is the responsibility of all investors, not just the point-of-contact or any other entrepreneur.</p>
