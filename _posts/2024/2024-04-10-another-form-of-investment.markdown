<div style='display:none; '>
 <p>There are many forms of investments that we had not thought of. Jose just came up with another..</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
<p>Instead of one-on-one, investments could be done with one person representing others. We think that a maximum of 10 is enough, but experiment. The number 10 makes possinle for a Radical Investee to still have direct discussions with the Radical Investors.</p>
<p>This, 10, is just a number. If you do not like it, experiment and come up with a number tat works for your community. We think that 10 or less is going to be good for the Radical Investee to have face-to-face discussions with the Radica Imvestors, as agroup or one-on-one.</p>
