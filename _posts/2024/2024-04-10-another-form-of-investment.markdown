<div style='display:none; '>
 <p>There are many forms of investments that we had not thought of. We just came up with another.</p>
</div>

<h1>Investments</h1>
 <p>Instead of one-on-one, investments could be done with one person representing others, maybe 10, not as an intermediary, but as a point of contact.</p>
 <p>A small group makes it possible for a Radical Invest<em>ee</em> to still have direct discussions with the Radical Invest<em>ors</em> as a group or one-on-one. You dont have to meet with all investors at one, but if you, a Radical Investor, is talking only to the intermediary that it may a creeping Fiat habit.</p>
 <p>This is the responsibility of all investors, not just the point-of-contact entrepreneuror any other entrepreneur.</p>
