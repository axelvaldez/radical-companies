 <p>Everybody is trying to contribute. For some, the mean is violence, for others, the mean is conversations. We must learn to teach conversations.</p>
</div>

<h1>Intelligence</h1>
 <p>From a very early age everyboby wants to contribute, we all do.</p>
 <p>I looked at Jean Piaget&rsquo;s <span class="_standout;">The Origins of Intelligence in Children>, 1956.</span>.</p>
 <p>The book is laid in Stages and intellignce does no appear until the Sixth Stage, <span class="_standout;">The Invention of New Means Through Mental Combinations</span> It is at this stage that the child learns how to communicate with their community<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> and simply go by the Fiat playbook, <span class="_standout">Be quiet</span>.</p>
 <p>But in spite of it all, some people learn to communicate. They learn to tell stories, the root of our humanity.</p>

<h1>All Good</h1>
 <p>To contribute we communicate intelligibly. When things come out in a <em>childish</em> way, it is up to adults around the child to show them, without being confrontatonal, how to say it, perhaps byrepeating the story.</p>
 <p>What we do mostly is to tell the child to &ldquo;<em>shut up.</em>&rdquo; instead teaching them to speak in a way that make sense to speak in a way that engages their humanity. A child that learns this will grow up happy and will help others live a happier live.</p>

<h1>Bad People, Good People</h1>
 <p>Bad people opt for violence. They <em>impose</em> their version of their reality on you.</p>
 <p>Violence begets more violence and it goes downhill from there. Hitler, in Germany and Putin, in Russia, are good examples of that: &ldquo;<em>I want them to <strong>fear</strong> me and celebrate me.</p>
 <p>They might have started with good intentions, but then they revert to the threat of violence a their way to control people. That is addictive.</p>

<h1>And, BTW&hellip; </h1>
 <p>&hellip; as we grow up, the Fiat system warps our intention to contribute to our community.
