 <p>Everybody is trying to contribute. For some, the mean is violence, for others, the mean is conversations. We must learn to teach conversations.</p>

<h1>Intelligence</h1>
 <p>From a very early age everyboby wants to contribute. We all do.</p>
 <p>To verify, I looked at Jean Piaget&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>The Origins of Intelligence in Children.</em>&rdquo; (<em>i.e.</em>, 1956).</p>
 <p>The book is laid in Stages. Intellignce does no appear until the Sixth Stage, &ldquo;<em>The Invention of New Means Through Mental Combinations</em>.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>It is at this stage that the child needs to also learn how to communicate with their coomunity. Some parents do this brilliantly for the child to express himself. Most do not do it at all<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> and simply go by the Fiat playbook, &ldquo;<em>Be quiet.</em>&rdquo;</p>
 <p>In spite of it all, some people learn to communicate. They learn to tell stories.</p>
 <p>Stories are at the root of our humanity.</p>

<h1>All Good</h1>
 <p>To contribute we communicate intelligibly. When things come out in a <em>childish</em> way, it is up to adults around the child to show them, without being confrontatonal, how to say it, perhaps byrepeating the story.</p>
 <p>What we do mostly is to tell the child to &ldquo;<em>shut up.</em>&rdquo; instead teaching them to speak in a way that make sense to speak in a way that engages their humanity. A child that learns this will grow up happy and will help others live a happier live.</p>

<h1>Bad People, Good People</h1>
 <p>Bad people almost always opt for violence. They impose their version of their reality on you.</p>
 <p>Violence begets more violence and it goes downhill from there. Hitler, in Germany and Putin, in Russia, are good examples of that: &ldquo;<em>I want them to <strong>fear</strong> me and celebrate me.</p>
 <p>They might have started with good intentions, but then they revert to the threat of violence a their way to control people. That is addictive.</p>

<h1>All of Us</h1>
 <p>As we grow up, the Fiat system warps our intention to contribute to our community. &ldquo;Be an adult.&rdquo;</p>
