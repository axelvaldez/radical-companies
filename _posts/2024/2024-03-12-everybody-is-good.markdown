 <p>Everybody is trying to contribute. For some, the mean is violence, for others, the mean is conversations. We must learn to teach conversations.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>From a very early age everyboby wants to contribute. We all do.</p>
 <p>For reassurance, I looked at Jean Piaget&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>The Origins of Intelligence in Children.</em>&rdquo; (<em>i.e.</em>, 1956). Piaget lays out the book in Stages. At its Sixth Stage, &ldquo;<em>The Invention of New Means Through Mental Combinations</em>,&rdquo; what we call intelligence appears.</p>
 <p>It is at this stage that the child needs to also start to learn how to communicate with their coomunity. Some parents do this brilliantly for te child to ex;ress himself. Most do not do it at all<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> and simply go by the Fiat playbook, &ldquo;<em>Shush. Be quiet.</em>&rdquo;</p>
 <p>I spite of it all, some people learn to communicate, and some people do it well. Stories are at the root of our humanity.</p>

<h1>All Good</h1>
 <p>From a very early age everyboby wants to contribute. This means that, among other things, we need to learn to communicate intelligibly. When things come out in <em>childish</em> way, it is up to adults around the child to teach them how to say it in a more comprehensible ways, preferably without being confrontatonal.</p>
 <p>What we do mostly is to tell the child to &ldquo;<em>shut up.</em>&rdquo; instead teaching them to speak in a way that make sense to the community, to speak in a way that engages their humanity. A child that learns that will grow up happy and will help others live a happier live.</p>

<h1>Bad People, Good People</h1>
 <p>Bad people almost always opt for violence. They impose their version of their reality on you. At best they ignore feedback, at worst it becomes a capital offense.</p>
 <p>Violence begets more violence and it goes downhill from there. Hitler, in Germany and Putin, in Russia, are good examples of that: &ldquo;<em>I want them to <strong>fear</strong> me and celebrate me.</em>. <em>Resistance is futile</em>&rdquo;.</p>
 <p>They might have started with good intentions, but then they noticed that the threat of violence was enough to control people. That is addictive.</p>

<h1>All of Us</h1>
 <p>It might have started with intentions that benefit our communities, but the Fiat system eventually warps our intentions which is to contribute to those around us. Even children like to contribute.</p>
