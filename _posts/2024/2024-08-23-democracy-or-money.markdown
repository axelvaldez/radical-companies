 <p>Democracy for all <em>or</em> accumulated power for a handful?</p>
</div>

<div class="_citation" >
 <p>We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can&rsquo;t have both.</p>
 <p id="_signature">Justice Louis Brandeis</p>

<p>The US and Europe have managed to do &lsquo;both&rsquo; with a slow back and forth between political parties. We may have to continue with the back-and-forth for a while, but eventually people and their well-being must be the highest priority.</p>
<p>We must alsp do away with the distinction between &lsquo;owners&rsquo; and &lsquo;employees&rsquo; and get used to Fadical Co-onwership as an alternative. We need to experiment and get experience with things like,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Make ownership based on contributions, not capital.</li>
  <li>Have work be collaborative, not competitive.</li>
  <li>Make work be guided by the well-being of people, not whatever makes money.</li>
 </ul>
