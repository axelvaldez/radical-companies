 <p>Democracy for all <em>or</em> accumulated power for a handful?</p>
</div>

<div class="_citation" >
 <p>We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can&rsquo;t have both.</p>
 <p id="_signature">Justice Louis Brandeis</p>
</div>
<p>The US, the European Union, Australia, and New Zeland have managed to do &lsquo;both&rsquo; with a slow back and forth between political partie, and that is what we call <em>democracy</em>. We may have to continue with the back-and-forth for a while, but eventually the well-being of people must be the highest priority.</p>
<p>We must also do away with the distinction between <span class="_standout">owners</span> and <span class="_standout">employees</span> and get familiar with Radical Co-onwership as an alternative.</p>
 <p>We need to experiment and get experience with things like,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Ownership is based on <span class="_standout">contributions</span>, not <span class="_standout">capital</span>.</li>
   <li>Work be a <span class="_standout">collaboration</span>, <strong>not</strong> <span class="_standout">competion</span>.</li>
   <li>Make work be <span class="_standout">guided by the well-being of people</span>, <span class="_standout">not whatever makes money</span>.</li>
  </ul>
