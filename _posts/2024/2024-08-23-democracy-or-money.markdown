 <p>Democracy for all or accumulated power for a handful?</p>
</div>

<div class="_citation" >
 <p>We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.</p>
 <p id="_signature">Justice Louis Brandeis</p>

<p>The US and Europe have managed to do &lsquo;both&rsquo; with a slow back and forth between political parties. We may need to continue with the back and forth for a while, but people are the highest priority of any system that comes to power.</p>
<p>We to finish the job by doing away with the distinction between &lsquo;owners&rsquo; and &lsquo;employees&rsquo; and get used to with co-onwership as an alternative like Radical so we can experiment with things like,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Make ownership based on contributions, not capital (everyone can contribute).</li>
  <li>Have work be collaborative, not (pseudo-)competitive.</li>
  <li>Make work be guided by the well-being of people, not whatever makes money.</li>
 </ul>
