 <p>Democracy for all or accumulated money for the few?</p>
</div>

<div class="_citation">
 <p>We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.</p>
 <p id="_signature">Justice Louis Brandeis</p>

<p>The US and Europe have managed to do a slow back and forth. We may need to continue with the back and forth, but we must make people the highest priority of all systems that come to power.</p>
<p>We managed to do away with a big part of slavery once; now we have to finish the job. An alternative system like Radical will let us experiment with things like,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Make ownership based on contributions, not capital (everyone can contribute).</li>
  <li>Have work be collaborative, not (pseudo-)competitive.</li>
  <li>Make them guided by the well-being of people, not whatever makes money for the Fiat owners.</li>
 </ul>
