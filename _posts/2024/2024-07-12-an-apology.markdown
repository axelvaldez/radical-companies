 <p>The Judeo-Christian religions were not wrong, they just did not go deep enough.</p>
</div>

<h1>Partners</h1>
 <p>The Judeo-Christian religions were not completely wrong and they can still be partners to Radical.</p>
 <p>They stopped at the unknown and called it <em>the soul</em>.</p>
 <p>These religions did not pop out of nothing. The Jewish religion was heavily ifluenced by the Zoroastrian religion</p>founded by Zarathustra, a Persian priest turned profet.</p>
 <p>Zarathustra wanted to set polytheistic (decentralized) religions straight with a single Boss God at the top (centralized) named Ahura Mazda.</p>
 <p>The Hebrews later added a written script, started Christianity, and globally kicked off (surprise!) what we know as the Fiat system.</p>

<h1>Holy Moments</h1>
 <p>My wife and some friends of hers formed a book club. Their latest book is <em>Holy Moments</em> by Matthew Kelly. The subtitle, <em>A Handbook for the Rest of Your Life</em>, was the first hint. I took a look at it and was dissapointed.</p>
 <p>Mr kelly, the author, had what he called his <span class="_standut">awakening</span> when he was 15 years old. I was ready for the worst.</p>
 <p>However, as I browsed the pages, it <em>reminded me</em> of the Radical Systemn.</p> 

<h1>Radical Eyes</h1>
 <p>He starts with,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>In is words, <span class="_standout">You may find yourself thinking or saying,</span></p>
    <ul class="_standout">>
     <li>Something is missigng&hellip;</li>
     <li>There must be more to life&hellip;</li>
     <li>I have more to offer&hellip;</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
 <p>As I read this I found myself shaking my head in agreement. Mr Kelly called these lines <span class="_standout">sacred truths</span>. The thing is that these quesions are key to Radical,too.</p>
 <p><span class="_standout">You are not malfunctioning</span>, he says, <span class="_standout">your intuition has never been so sharp</span>.</p>
 <p>What is object to is assigning it to the supernatural.</p>

 <h1>Something Is Missing</h1>
  <p>What is missing is the ability to say no and falling back on the supernatural.</p>

<h1>The Soul</h1>
  <p>If you are an impressionable 15 years old, or in the Iron Age, you can get away with it, but in the 21<sup>th</sup> Century there is no need for mysticism.</p>

<h1>Progress</h1>
 <p>Later on in the book Mr Kelly asks <span class="_standout">What is progress?</span> and, he asnwers, <span class="_standout">Preserving the well-being of human beings.</span>!</p>

 <h1>Collaboration</h1>
 <p>He mentions <span class="_standout">collaboration</span> to say <span class="_standout">collaborate with God.</span></p>
 <p>He keeps repeating <span class="_standout">revelations from the Christian god</span>. Again, mysticism might have been unavoidable in the past, but it is inexcusable today.</p>

<h1>The Apology</h1>
 <p>In any case, in general, it sound like Christians are looking for the same things as the Radical systeman and we could be partners.</p>
 <p>Well, not all Christians.</p>
 <p><span class="_standout">Authauthotiarians</span> like Mr Kelly want you to take his words for what to pay attention to and what to ignore because only they know what is important and true, according to his <span class="_standut">awakening</span>.</p>

<h1>Radical and Christians</h1>
 <p>Radical and christians want a more equitable world.</p>
 <p>They want our world to be people-centric, not money-centric.</p>
 <p>And they also want</p>
  <ul>
   <li>To take care of each other</li>
   <li>To make choices</li>
   <li>To discover more of the world.</li>
  </ul>
