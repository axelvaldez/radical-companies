<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>The Judeo-Christian religions weren't wrong, they just didn't go deep enough. They stopped at the unknown, not surprising for the iron age. They called the soul.</p>
 <p>To be sure, they didn't pop out of nothing. My educated guess is that the Jewish religion came from Zoroastrianism, founded by Zarahustra, a Persian priest turned profet (made famous by Stanley Kubrick&lsquo;s movie <em>>2001: A Space Odyseey</em>). Interestingly, Zarahustra wanted to <em>correct</em> polytheistic religions he had receibed a vision of one true god, not mulitiple. Then the Hebrews added written script and it kicked off what we now know as Fiat.</p>

<h1>Holy Moments</h1>
 <p>My wife and some friends formed a book club. The latest book is <em>Holy Moments</em> by Matthew Kelly. At first we dismissed it as an &ldquo;I BELIEVE&rdquo; booklet, which indeed it is.</p>
 <p>The subtitle, <em>A Handbook for the Rest of Your Life</em>. was the first hint. The author, Mr kelly, had his &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; when he was 15 years old and has been caught in this particular story ever since.</p>

<h1>W Eyes</h1>
 <p>As I browsed the pages, it reminded me of the Radical Systemn. For example, in the <em>Awakening</em> sectiom he starts with,</p>
  <ul>
   You may find yourself thinking or saying&;
   <li>Something is missigng&hellip;</li>
   <li>There must be more to life&hellip;</li>
   <li>I have more to offer&hellip;</li>
 </ul>
 <p>i found myself shaking my head up and down in agreement. Mr Kelly called them &lsquo;sacred truths&rsquo;, meaningless in the 21<sup>th</sup> century. Nevertheless, those quesions are key to Radical."You are not malfunctioning," Mr kelly says, &ldquo;your intuition has nver been so sharp.&rdquo; OIndeed.</p>
 <p>What is missing is what to do about it.</p>
