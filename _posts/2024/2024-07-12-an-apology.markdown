<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>The Judeo-Christian religions weren't wrong, they just didn't go deep enough. They stop at the unknown, not surprising for the iron age. what was brilliant is the ]y made up a name for it: the soul.</p>
 <p>To be sure, they didn't pop out of nothing. My educated guess is that the Jewish faith came from &ldquo;Zoroastrianism (also given as Mazdayasna, &lsquo;devotion to Mazda&&rsquo;.&rdquo;)</p>
