 <p>The Judeo-Christian religions weren't wrong, they just didn't go deep enough.</p>

<h1>Partners</h1>
 <p>The Judeo-Christian religions weren't wrong, but theymcan still be Partners to Radical model. They just didn't go deep enough. They stopped at the unknown and they called it the soul.</p>
 <p>These religions didn't pop out of nothing. My guess is that the Jewish religion came from Zoroastrian religion, founded by Zarathustra, a Persian priest turned profet.</p>
 <p>Zarathustra wanted to set polytheistic religions straight with a single boss God at the top, Ahura Mazda, not mulitiple gods. His teachings were aural. The Hebrews later added a written script and kicked off what we know as Fiat.</p>

<h1>Holy Moments</h1>
 <p>My wife and some friends formed a book club. The latest book is <em>Holy Moments</em> by Matthew Kelly. The subtitle, <em>A Handbook for the Rest of Your Life</em>, was the first hint tjat it was mostly mysticism and authoritarian. The author, Mr kelly, had his &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; when he was 15 years old and has been caught in this particular story ever since.</p>
 <p>However, as I browsed the pages, it reminded me of the Radical Systemn.</p> 

<h1>Radical Eyes</h1>
 <p>In the <em>Awakening</em> sectiom he starts with,
   &ldquo;You may find yourself thinking or saying,
  <ul>
   <li>Something is missigng&hellip;</li>
   <li>There must be more to life&hellip;</li>
   <li>I have more to offer&hellip; &rdquo;</li>
 </ul>
 <p>As I read this lines I was shaking my head up and down in agreement. Mr Kelly called them &lsquo;sacred truth.s&rsquo; These quesions are key to Radical. &ldquo;You are not malfunctioning,&rdquo; Mr kelly says, &ldquo;your intuition has nveer been so sharp.&rdquo; Indeed.</p>
 <p>What is missing is going donw to the root of the reason and what to do about it.</p>
 <p>This is not a criticism, it id an observton and the basis of my apology. this was radical for the era the Bibile was written was wrtten.</p>

 <h1>Something Is Missing</h1>
  <p>What is missng is the ability to say no to tedium and yes to &ldquo;there is more to life&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have more to offer.&rdquo; If the boss says, &ldquo;open a hole here&rdquo; you do it or else. Mauybe it is there, but there is no focus.</p>

<h1>The Soul</h1>
  <p>What the authors of the Bible, and Mr Kelly, meant by &ldquo;the soul&rdquo; is the sum of everything they did not know. In 2024 we know more about the body and the mind. There is no need for mysticism.</p>

<h1>Progress</h1>
 <p>Later on in the book he asks &ldquo;What is progress?&rdquo; andf he asnwers, &ldquo;Improving the well-being of human beings.&rdquo; And I agree with him wholehartedly. He understands the problem well.</p>

<h1>Progress</h1>
 <p>When it comes to the answers, the only time he mentions &ldquo;collaborataion&rdquo; is to say &ldquo;collaborate with God.&rdquo; When it comes tp people he keeps repeating &ldquo;Holy Moments.&rdquo; as revelations from his God. Mysticism in the iron age was unavoidable.</p>

<h1>New Partners</h1>
 <p>Sounds like Christians are looking for the same answers as the Radical model. They could be our partners.</p>
 <p>Well, not all &ldquo;Christians.&ldquo; Gentle authotiarians, like Mr Kelly, want to tell you what really is important and true in the Christian Bible. They exploit the mysticism in the Christian Bible to convince you of what they decide is the truth.</p>

 <h1>rRadical</h1>
  <p>Radical and Christians want a more equitable world. We want to our world to be people-centric, not money-centric. To take care of each other. To make our own choices and to discover more of the world that makes us tik.</p>
  <p>We could all do all that and more with today&lsquo;s technology.</p>

 &lt;/end of apology&gt;
