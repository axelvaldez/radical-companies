<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>The Judeo-Christian religions weren't wrong, they just didn't go deep enough. They stopped at the unknown, not surprising for the iron age. They called the soul.</p>
 <p>To be sure, they didn't pop out of nothing. My educated guess is that the Jewish religion came from Zoroastrianism, founded by Zarathustra, a Persian priest turned profet (made famous by Stanley Kubrick&lsquo;s movie <em>>2001: A Space Odyseey</em>).</p>
 <p>Zarathustra wanted to <em>correct</em> polytheistic religions he had a vision of one true god, Ahura Mazda, not mulitiple gods. Then the Hebrews added written script and kicked off what we now know as Fiat.</p>

<h1>Holy Moments</h1>
 <p>My wife and some friends formed a book club. The latest book is <em>Holy Moments</em> by Matthew Kelly. At first we dismissed it as an &ldquo;I BELIEVE&rdquo; booklet, which indeed it is.</p>
 <p>The subtitle, <em>A Handbook for the Rest of Your Life</em>. was the first hint. The author, Mr kelly, had his &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; when he was 15 years old and has been caught in this particular story ever since.</p>

 <p>As I browsed the pages, it reminded me of the Radical Systemn. For example, in the <em>Awakening</em> sectiom he starts with,</p>
  <ul>
<h1>Radical Eyes</h1>
   You may find yourself thinking or saying&hellip;
  <ul>
   <li>Something is missigng&hellip;</li>
   <li>There must be more to life&hellip;</li>
   <li>I have more to offer&hellip;</li>
 </ul>
 <p>As I read it I was shaking my head up and down in agreement. Mr Kelly called them &lsquo;sacred truths&rsquo;. Ths is meaningless in the 21<sup>th</sup> century. On the other hand, put a little bit differently those quesions are key to Radical."You are not ma lfunctioning," Mr kelly says, &ldquo;your intuition has nver been so sharp.&rdquo; Indeed.</p>
 <p>kwhat is missing is going donw into more radial detal and what to do about it.</p>
 <p>This is not a criticism of a book written  te iron age. It id an observton and the basis of my apology: this was radical for the time t was wrtten.</p>

 <h1>Something Is Missing</h1>
  <p>What is missng is the ability to say no to tedium and yes to &ldquo;there is more to life&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have more to offer.&rdquo; If the boss says, &ldquo;move the box from ere to there&rdquo; you do it or else. What mkissing is the ability to try thins out and to accummulate wealth. To be buman to live your life without goping homeless or going hungry.</p>

<h1>The Soul</h1>
   <p>What the authors of the Bible, and Mr Kelly, meant by the soul is the sum of everything they didn't know about about the body and the mind. In 2024 we know more the body and the mind. We don&rsquo;t need te soul.</p>
