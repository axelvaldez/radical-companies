 <p><em>Escape from Freedom</em> was published in 1941. Pim de Morre, co-founder of <em>Corporate Rebels</em>, reminded me of it (he is reading it). I read it when I was 18-19 years old (I am a mere 73 now).</p>

<h1>Disturbing</h1>
 <p>This quote I found at first disturbing,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p><em>Private property is a necessary institution</em>, men work more and dispute less when goods are private than when they are common.</p>
   <p id="_signature">Eric Fromm. <em>Escape from Freedom</em></p>
  </div>
 <p>I guess it disturbed me because in the Radical systemv &lsquo;private&rsquo; is unexpected, unless we are talking about a toothbrush<a href='#en02'><sup id='bm02'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>Again</h1>
 <p>I read it again and it really does not conflict with Radical if instead of &rsquo;property&lsquo; it had said,
  <div class="_citation">
   <p><em>Production of</em> private <em>goods</em> is a necessary institution.</p>
  </div>
 <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>&hellip; they reflect to some extent the actual spirit of medieval society.</p>

  </div>

<h1>The Money Class</h1>
 <p>This was surprising as well,</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>By the 15<sup>th</sup> century</em>&hellip; the shares belonged to capitalists &hellip; and increasingly the work was done by workers who were paid wages and had no share in the enterprise.</p>
  <p id="_signature">Eric Fromm. <em>Escape from Freedom</em></p>
 </div>
 <p>This means that the Fiat thing was in full swing <em>before</em> the 15<sup>th</sup> Century. Nobodhy noticed, or perhaps they did, that it was started by Kings and Queens to collect taxes.</p>

    A company is not a property that can be bought and sold, it is a group people working towards making an impact. Of course, a <em>company</em> can be converted to a private <em>business</em> and then sold.
