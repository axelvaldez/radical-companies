 <p><em>Escape from Freedom</em> was published in 1941. Pim de Morre, co-founder of <em>Corporate Rebels</em>, reminded me of it. I first read it when I was 18-19 years old (I am a mere 73 now).</p>

<h1>Freedom!</h1>
 <div class="_citation">

 <p>By the end of the American Revolution, mankind had overthrown the domination of,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Nature</li>
   <li>The Church</li>
   <li>The absolutist state</li>
 </ul>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>One tie after another had been severed.</p>

<h1>Fighting for All</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>The abolition of external domination seemed to be not only a necessary but also a sufficient condition to attain the cherished goal: freedom of the individual.</p>

 <p>But it was not freedom for <em>all</em> individuasn that Americans were fighting for, it was really freedom for a specific class of land and slave owner wealthy Europeans. They didallmthis while looked down at <em>poor Europeans</em> (unreliable), <em>American Indians</em> (hostile to the European ways), and, of course, <em>African slaves</em> (who?).</p>

 <div class="_citation">
  <p>The principles of economic liberalism, political democracy, religious autonomy, and individualism in personal life, gave expression to the longing for freedom, and at the same time seemed to bring mankind nearer to its realization.</p>

 <p>The people who wrote the US Constitution thought they were fighting for <em>the longing for freedom in  all individual</em>. Fortunately, this ideal is what has stuck to his day.</p>
