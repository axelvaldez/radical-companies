 <p><em>Escape from Freedom</em> was published in 1941. Pim de Morre, co-founder of <em>Corporate Rebels</em>, reminded me of it (he is reading it). I read it when I was 18-19 years old (I am a mere 73 now).</p>

<h1>Freedom!</h1>
 <p>By the end of the American Revolution mankind had overthrown the domination of,</p>

   <li>Nature</li>
   <li>The Church</li>
   <li>The &hellip; state</li>

<h1>Fighting for All (the Wealthyxxx)</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>The abolition of external domination seemed to be not only a necessary but also a sufficient condition to attain the cherished goal: freedom of the individual.</p>

 <p>But it was not freedom for <em>all</em> individuals in the US. It was really freedom for a specific class of wealthy land-owner and slave-owner Europeans. They wrote this while they looked down at,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Poor Europeans (unreliable)</li>
   <li>American Indians (hostile)</li>
   <li>Africans and their descendants (who?)<a href='#en02'><sup id='bm02'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></li>
  </ul>
 
<h1>The Federalists</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>The principles of economic liberalism, political democracy, religious autonomy, and individualism in personal life, gave expression to the longing for freedom, and at the same time seemed to bring mankind nearer to its realization.</p>

 <p>The good news is that the people who wrote the US Constitution saw themselves as fighters for <em>freedom</em> For All. Fortunately, this <em>ideal</em> has stuck to his day.</p>
