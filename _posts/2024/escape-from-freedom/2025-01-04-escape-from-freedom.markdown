 <p><em>Escape from Freedom</em> was published in 1941. Pim de Morre, co-founder of <em>Corporate Rebels</em>, reminded me of it (he is reading it!). I read it when I was 18-19 years old (I am a mere 73 now).</p>

 <p>Ciao. A la prochaine. Hasta la pr√≥xima. See you.</p>

<h1>Read Me</h1>
 <p>First came the prokaryotes (&lsquo;<span styles="font-family: courier; font-size:smaller; ">SURVIVE!<span>&rsquo;) and then came eukaryoutes (Do not eat the liver, <span styles="font-family:courier; font-size:smaller; ">HE IS A FRIEND</span>).</p>
<p>Eukaryotes won by collaborating and can read Miguel de Cervantes!<a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>New Rules</h1>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>As cells transitioned  from rivals to teammates, new rules were needed.</p>

 <p>And that is the rub. People (<em>i.e.</em>, the cells) will protest vociferously against collaboration <em>with strangers</em>. It is all well and good with friends and family, but, damn, not with foreigners! Because they are smart, eventually they will collaborate with what used-to-be strangers as well, but it will take a long, long time. This is not for the impatient.</p>
 <p>My guess is that,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The first-to-second generations will fight it.</li>
   <li>The second-to-third generations will transition.</li>
   <li>By the third-to-fourth generation collaboration will be a given.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>However, the mob<a href='#en02'><sup id='bm02'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> is still there, in all of us, and must be dealt with. That is why nice, polite people turns into a mob at the first sign of fire and then revert to <span class="_italized">normal, polite</span> people afterwards.</p>
