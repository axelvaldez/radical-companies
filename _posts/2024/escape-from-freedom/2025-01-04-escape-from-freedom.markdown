 <p><em>Escape from Freedom</em> was published in 1941. Pim de Morre, co-founder of <em>Corporate Rebels</em>, reminded me of it (he is reading it!). I read it when I was 18-19 years old (I am a mere 73 now).</p>

 <p>Ciao. A la prochaine. Hasta la pr√≥xima. See you.</p>

 <p>First came the prokaryotes (SURVIVE!) and then came eukaryoutes (Do not eat the liver, HE IS A FRIEND).</p>
 <p>Eukaryotes won by collaborating and can read Shakespeare!</p>

   <p>As cells transitioned  from rivals to teammates, new rules were needed.</p>

  </div> 
 <p>And that is the rub. The cells (<em>i.e.</em>, human beings), will protest vociferously against collaboration <em>with strangers</em>. It is all well and good with friends and family, but, damn, not with strangers!</p>
 <p>Eventually they will collaborate, because they are smart with (what-used-to-be-strangers) teammates as well, but it will take a long, long time. This is not for the impatient. The first gemeration will fight it religion will be involved (not to be irrevelant).</p>
 <p>The second generation will transition.</p>
 <p>By the third generation collaboration will be a given.</p>
 <p>However, the initial programming is still there. For example, that is why a crowd of nice, polite people will turn into a mob at the first sign of fire. That same mob, will revert to <span id="italized">normal, polite</span> people afterwards.</p>
