 <p><em>Escape from Freedom</em> was published in 1941. Pim de Morre, co-founder of <em>Corporate Rebels</em>, reminded me of it (he is reading it!). I read it when I was 18-19 years old (I am a mere 73 now).</p>

 <p>Ciao. A la prochaine. Hasta la próxima. See you.</p>

 <p>According to Dr Jason Fung, first came thene were prokaryotes (SURVIVE!) and then came eucaryoutes (Do not eat your liver, he is a friend). Eukaryotes won, collaboration won and can read Shakespeare!</p>

   <p>As cells transitioned  from rivals to teammates, new rules were needed.</p>

 <p>And that is the rub. The cells/human beings, will protest vociferously against collaboration <em>with strangers</em>. It is all well and good with friends and family, but, damn, not with strangers!</p>
 <p>Eventually they will collaborate with (what-used-to-be-strangers-but-now-are-)teammates as well, but it will take a long, long time. This is not for the impatient. The first gemeration will fight it, and the secongd generation will transition. By the third generation collaboration will be a fact, but the initial programming is nstill there. That is why a crowd of polite people will turn into a mob at the the first sign of fire. That same mob, and will revert to <span id="italized">normal</span> polite people after the disaster.</p>
