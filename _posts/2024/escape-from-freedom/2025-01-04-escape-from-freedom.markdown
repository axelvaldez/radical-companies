 <p><em>Escape from Freedom</em> was published in 1941. Pim de Morre, co-founder of <em>Corporate Rebels</em>, reminded me of it (he is reading it!). I read it when I was 18-19 years old (I am a mere 73 now).</p>

 <p>This is my &lsquo;<em>ciao, revoir, hasta luego, so long.</em>&rsquo;</p>

<h1>Aqui Va Lo Importanteâ€¦</h1>
 <p>According to Dr Jason Fung, first came thene were prokaryotes (SURVIVE!) and then came eucaryoutes (Do not eat your liver, he is a friend). Eukaryotes won, collaboration won and can read Shakespeare!</p>
  <div class="_citation">
  As cells transitioned  from rivals to teammates, new rules were needed.
  </div>
 <p>And that is the rub. The cells, called human beinbgs, will rebel vociferously aginst collaboration with stranges. It is all well and good with some friends and family, but not with strangers. Yuck!</p>
 <p>Eventually they will collaborate with (used-to-be-strangers-but-now-are-)teammates as well, but it will take a long, long time. This is not for the impatient.</p>
 <p>The firstngemeration will fight it, and the secongd generation will transition. By the third generation collaboration will be a fact, but the initial programming is nstill there. That is why a crowd of polite people will turn into a mob at the the first sign of fire. That same mob, and will revert to <_italized>normal</_italized> polite people after the disaster.</p>
