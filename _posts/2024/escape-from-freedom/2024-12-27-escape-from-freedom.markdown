 <p><em>Escape from Freedom</em> was published in 1941. Pim de Morre, co-founder of <em>Corporate Rebels</em>, reminded me of it. I first read it when I was 18-19 years old (I am a mere 73 now).</p>

  <p>We have been compelled to recognize that millions in Germany were as eager to surrender their freedom as their fathers were to fight for it. That instead of wanting freedom, they sought for ways of <em>escape from it</em>.</p>
  <p>&hellip;</p>
  <p>The crisis of democracy is not a peculiar Italian or German problem, but confronting every modern state.</p>

<h1>John Dewey</h1>
 <p>This truth has been forcefully said by John Dewey,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>The serious threat to our democracy is not the existance of foreign totalitarian states. It is the existence within our own personal attitudes and within our own institutions of conditions which have given a victory to external authority, discipline, uniformity and dependence upon <em>The Leader</em> in foreign countries.<a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
  </div>
 <p>One evidence of this is the recent (Dec 30, 2024) win of a second, and hopefully last, term by Donald Trump as President of the US.</p>
