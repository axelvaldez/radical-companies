 <p><em>Escape from Freedom</em> was published in 1941. Pim de Morre, co-founder of <em>Corporate Rebels</em>, reminded me of it(he is reading it!). I first read it when I was 18-19 years old (I am a mere 73 now).</p>

<h1>Yesterday</h1>
 <p>(No, not the Beatle song.) On Jan 1, 2025, wy wife reminded me of other things, besides <em>Escape from Freedom</em>,<a href='#en01><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> that should propably be in the chain that lead me to Radical. Including a lecture by Fernando Flores.</p>

 <h1>Flores</h1>
 <p>Flores, a former Cabinet Member in Allende&rsquo;s government, was in a Chilean jail for three years until the Amnesty International group in San Francisco got him out.</p>
 <p>He did not focus on his time in jail. In fact, he never mentioned it except when giving credit to Amnesty International for getting him out.</p>
 <p>Flores is 81 as ofthisw writing and he isn still an original. He talked more about the lessons from the Pinochet period, including the good. He prefaced by saying something like, &ldquo;<em>you might be surprised, but there were a couple of things we learned from Pinochet</em>.&rdquo; (There were a lot of Chileans in the audience).</p>
 <p>There was nothing in particular that would have predicted Radical. He was a not-so-good teacher but he managed to show us how to think diffrently. <em>That</em> was very valuable and has stayed with me.<a href='#en02'><sup id='bm02'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
