 <p><em>Escape from Freedom</em> was published in 1941. Pim de Morre, co-founder of <em>Corporate Rebels</em>, reminded me of it(he is reading it!). I first read it when I was 18-19 years old (I am a mere 73 now).</p>

<h1>Yesterday</h1>
 <p>No, not the Beatle song, but on Jan 1, 2025 my wife reminded me of other things, besides <em>Escape from Freedom</em>,<a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> that should propably be in the chain that lead me to Radical, including a workshop by Fernando Flores.</p>

<h1>Carlos <em>Fernando Flores</em> Labra</h1>
 <p>Flores, a former young Cabinet Member in Allende&rsquo;s government, was thrown in jail by Pinochet&lsquo;s regime for three years until the Amnesty International group in San Francisco managed to get him out.</p>
 <p>During the workhop he did not focus on his time in jail. In fact, he never mentioned it except when giving credit to Amnesty International for getting him out.</p>
 <p>He talked about the lessons from the Pinochet period, surprinsingly including the &ldquo;good.&rdquo; He prefaced by saying something like, &ldquo;<em>there were a couple of things we learned from Pinochet. Hold your comments</em>.&rdquo; (There were a lot of Chileans in the audience, because of Pinochet).</p>
 <p>As of 2025, Flores is 823 and still an original thinker</p>
 <p>There was nothing in particular in then workshop that would have predicted Radical. He was a so-so teacher but he managed to show us how to think differently. <em>That</em> was very valuable and has stayed with me.<a href='#en02'><sup id='bm02'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

    I heard about the Fernando Flores workhop while at The Forum, originally EST, a creation of the infamous William Erhard (born John Paul Rosenberg).
