<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership may be the most difficult thing to fully get. A company without a CEO? That is impossible! How would they know what to do? How would they set a strategy? It is going to be chaos or some very run of the mill.</p>

<h1>Ho-Hum?</h1>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s start with the last concern: It is going to be chaos or some very run of the mill. That w0ould be true if you assume that people cannot or will not <em>learn</em>. but that is wrong headed. People like to learn. It may take more time to arrive at a decisiob the first few tries around, until they start to figure out who to trust.</p>
 <p>But people like to learn. Today, withib the Fiat system, we do what the boss says, but that is not <em>&rdquo;humsn nature&rdquo; or any such, it is just what we have been taught to do.</p>
