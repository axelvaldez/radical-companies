 <p>Co-ownership may be the most difficult thing to fully &lsquo;get,&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership may be the most difficult thing to fully &lsquo;get,&rsquo; and even harder to implement. But do not worry and just get started.</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>A business without managers. <em>That is impossible!</em></p>
  </div>

<h1>Impossible?</h1>
 <p>Not, it is not!</p>
 <p>A company without leaders, <em>that</em> is impossible.</p>
 <p>If nobody takes the leadership, then it is not needed or well defined and you will need to make it so.</p>
 <p>Ignore questions like,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>How would they know what to do?</li>
   <li>How would they set a strategy?</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Ho-Hum?</h1>
 <p>Is it going to be chaos or ho-hum?</p>
 <p>That could be true if you assume that people cannot, or will not <em>learn</em>.</p>
 <p>People learn. Within the Fiat system we learn to do what the boss says. But that is not <em>&rdquo;human nature&rdquo;</em> or any such, it is simply what we have been taught to do and expected of us by the people we trust.</p>
 <p>The Fiat system is in our heads and we simply pass on We pride ourselves to being <em>individualistic</em>, to <em>beat</em> the other guy<, to <em>enjoy</em> a crushing win.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>But these are all part of the Fiat system.</p>
 <p>Radical offers alternatives,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Ongoing learning</li>
   <li>From unexpected results</li>
   <li>To embrace our ignorance</li>
   <li>To ask questions.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>The Radical System</h1>
  <p>Radical also teaches us that action happens only in community. Even when we are working alone we get inspirations from it (<em>e.g.</em>, books, documentaries, fantasy movies)</p>

<h1>Triple</h1>
 <p>The main purpose of the Radical model is to make people&lsquo; well-being the highest priority. We think that you can make more money not having managers and be more innovative with other people and their communties.</p>
 <p>The other day I spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/halukcanhur/" target="_blank">Haluk Can Hur</a>, a Turkish business person who happens to own four businesses, all of them co-managed. He told me that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?fetchDeterministicClustersOnly=true&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Aorganization%3A5148270&keywords=latro%20kimya&origin=RICH_QUERY_SUGGESTION&position=0&searchId=e92cfcd5-7f9b-4b3b-a0c0-aa4924019de7&sid=G1i&spellCorrectionEnabled=false" target="_blank">Latro Kimya</a>, his first business, has tripled its revenue since he eliminated the CEO job and himself. People who manage the business know the ins and outs of it, and do not have to ask for permission.</p>
 <p>And that is for a just co-managed business, without co-ownership.</p>
 <p>He is giving away his shares to the workers. Unfortunately, the decision of who-gets-what is his, centralized and not transparent.</p>

<h1>The Radical Foundation</h1>
 <p>This is all you have to remember,

<h1>Idealistic?</h1>
  <ul>
   <li>Businessess do not work for the community, they exist to make money for their owners.</li>
   <li>Radical companies are free to run financial circles around them, but that is not their goal.</li>
   <li>Their main goal is to decentralize. The goal of businesses is to collaborate.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Other things that are <em>business hostile</em> about Fiat businesses,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Individuals win</li>
   <li>Being number one</li>
   <li>Crushing the competition</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Radical companies win when a community thrives, the world thrives, and people thrive.</p>
