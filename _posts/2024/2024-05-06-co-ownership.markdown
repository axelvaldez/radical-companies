 <p>Co-ownership may be the most difficult thing to fully get. A company without a CEO? That is impossible.</p>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership may be the most difficult thing to fully get. How would they know what to do? How would they set a strategy? It is going to be chaos or at best very ho-hum.</p>

<h1>Ho-Hum?</h1>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s start with the last concern: It is going to be chaos or very ho-hum. That w0ould be true if you assume that people cannot or will not <em>learn</em>. but that is wrong headed. People like to learn. It may take more time to arrive at a decision the first few tries, until they, the people without a boss, start to figure out who to trust. And if never get tothat point, they wer never became a team and will disband.</p>
 <p>But people like to learn. Within the Fiat system we learn to do what the boss says. But that is not <em>&rdquo;human nature&rdquo;</em> or any such, it is simply what we have been taught to do and to expect by the people we trust the most: our parents, our teachers. The Radical system offers an alternatives,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>To learn and keep learning</li>
   <li>To not be surprised, but to learn from unexpected results</li>
   <li>To embrace our ignorance and ask questions.</li>
  </ul>
