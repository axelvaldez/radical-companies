 <p>Co-ownership may be the most difficult thing to fully get. A company without a CEO? That is impossible.</p>
</div>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership may be the most difficult thing to fully get. How would they know what to do? How would they set a strategy? It is going to be chaos or at best very ho-hum.</p>

<h1>Ho-Hum?</h1>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s start with the last concern: It is going to be chaos or very ho-hum. That w0ould be true if you assume that people cannot or will not <em>learn</em>. but that is wrong headed. People like to learn. It may take more time to arrive at a decision the first few tries, until they, the people without a boss, start to figure out who to trust. And if never get tothat point, they wer never became a team and will disband.</p>
 <p>But people like to learn. Within the Fiat system we learn to do what the boss says. But that is not <em>&rdquo;human nature&rdquo;</em> or any such, it is simply what we have been taught to do and to expect by the people we trust the most: our parents, our teachers. The Radical system offers alternatives,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>To learn and keep learning</li>
   <li>To not be negatively surprised, but to learn from unexpected results</li>
   <li>To embrace our ignorance and ask questions.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Triple</h1>
 <p>Yesterday I spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/halukcanhur/" target="_blank">Haluk Can Hur</a>, a Turkish fellow who happens to own four businesses, all of them co-managed. He told me that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?fetchDeterministicClustersOnly=true&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Aorganization%3A5148270&keywords=latro%20kimya&origin=RICH_QUERY_SUGGESTION&position=0&searchId=e92cfcd5-7f9b-4b3b-a0c0-aa4924019de7&sid=G1i&spellCorrectionEnabled=false" target="_blank">Latro Kimya</a>, one of his businesses, has tripled its revenue since he fired himself from the CEO job. This comes from people managing the business, knowing the ins and outs of it, and not having to ask for permission.</p>
 <p>And that is for a co-managed business, no co-ownership. He is giving away his shares to the workers over time, but the ownership is still centralized.</p>

<h1>Idealistic?</h1>
 <p>Fiat businesses are businesses-hostile. Radical companies are free to run circles around them, but that is not their main goal. Their main goal is to decentralize wealth, not according to capital, but according to people&rsquo;s contributions. The goal of companies is not to compete but to be the training ground for learning to collaborate.</p>
 <p>The mindset of <em>being number one</em> and crushing the competition is business-hostile as well. The mindset of <em>individual wins</em> is business-hostile, too. We win when our society thrives, when all people thrive.</p>
