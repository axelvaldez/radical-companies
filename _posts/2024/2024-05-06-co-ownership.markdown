 <p>Co-ownership may be the most difficult thing to fully &lsquo;get,&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership may be the most difficult thing to fully get and even harder to implement. But do not worry. Just get started.</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>A business without managers. <em>That is impossible!</em></p>
  </div>
 <p>Not, it is not!</p>
 <p>A company without leaders, <em><strong>that</strong></em> is impossible. And if nobody takes the reponsibility, then it is not needed. or well defined. You must start all over again. Remember, there is no rank!</p>
 <p>Ignore questions like,</p>
  <ul>
   <em>
   <li>How would the unwashed masses know what to do?</li>
   <li>How would they set a strategy?</li>
   <li>It is going to be chaos or at best very ho-hum.</li>
   </em>
  </ul>

<h1>Ho-Hum?</h1>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s start with the last concern: It is going to be chaos or very ho-hum. That could be true if you assume that people cannot or will not <em>learn</em>, but that is wrong.</p>
 <p>But people learn. Within the Fiat system we learn to do what the boss says. But that is not <em>&rdquo;human nature&rdquo;</em> or any such, it is simply what we have been taught to do and expect by the people we trust.</p>
 <p>The Fiat system is in our heads and we simply pass on. We pride ourselves to be individuals, to beat the other guy, and enjoy a crushing win. Those are all part of the Fiat system.</p>
 <p>The Radical system offers alternatives,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Ongoing learning</li>
   <li>To learn from unexpected results</li>
   <li>To embrace our ignorance and ask questions.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Radical</h1>
  <p>Radical also teaches us that action happens only in community. Even when we are working alone we get inspirations from the community (<em>e.g.</em>, books, documentaries, fantasy movies)</p>

<h1>Triple</h1>
 <p>The main purpose of the Radical model is to make people&lsquo; well-being the highest priority. Yes, you can make more money not having managers (less useless cost) and more innovative. People and their communties are the primary source.</p>
 <p>The other day I spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/halukcanhur/" target="_blank">Haluk Can Hur</a>, who happens to own four businesses, all of them co-managed. He told me that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?fetchDeterministicClustersOnly=true&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Aorganization%3A5148270&keywords=latro%20kimya&origin=RICH_QUERY_SUGGESTION&position=0&searchId=e92cfcd5-7f9b-4b3b-a0c0-aa4924019de7&sid=G1i&spellCorrectionEnabled=false" target="_blank">Latro Kimya</a>, his first business, has tripled its revenue since he eliminated the CEO job and fired himself. People manage the business, they know the ins and outs of it, and do not have to ask for permission.</p>
 <p>And that is for a just co-managed business. Without co-ownership.</p>
 <p>He is giving away his shares to the workers. Unfortunately, the decision of who-gets-what is centralized and not transparent.</p>

<h1>The Radical Foundation</h1>
 <p>As a reminder, this defines the Radical Foundation. It is all you have to remember,

<h1>Idealistic?</h1>
 <p>Businessess don&rsquo;t work for the community, they exist for their owners. Radical companies are free to run financial circles around them, but that is not their main goal. Their main goal is to decentralize according to people&rsquo;s contributions, not capital. The goal of companies is not to compete but to be the training ground for collaboration.</p>
 <p>Other things that are business hostile,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><em>Being number one</em></li>
   <li><em>Crushing the competition</em></li>
   <li><em>Individual wins</em></li>
  </ul>
 <p>We all win when our community, the world, and people thrive.</p>
