<h1>In the Beginning</h1>
 <p>Something wanted to come out of me. Why did I make so much more money than the rest of them when we sold the company where in reality they had a bigger hand in making the company grow?</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  &ldquo;Well you did a lot of other things, too. Other people just want a paycheck&rdquo;
 </div>
 <p>These questions kept going around and around in my head, and these traditional answers sounded hollow. And it is not like I hate money or anything like that.</p>

<h1>Community</h1>
 <p>Later, Jose and I were introduced by Doug Kirkpatrick, self-management extraordinaire, and we started to have conversations, too.</p>
 (<p>Eventually Adrian, Jose, and I had conversations and I started writing the book Radical Companies.</p>

<h1>Many Conversations</h1>
 <p>The three of us, Adrian, Jose, and I, ended up meeting for about a year and an alternative system based on contributions started to take shape.</p>
 <p>Before that we checked with many people, including luminaries, but they did not have answers, either. At least, not satisfactory  answers.</p>
 <p>In particular, none identified ownership as a barrier.</p>

<h1>Fiat &amp; Radical</h1>
 <p>We came up with Fiat, “because I said so,” as the name of the system we live in. I had used the word Fiat once trying to explain that a CORP, LLC, LLP, and similar others, including established co-cops, were all the same. And Fiat resonated with people.</p>
 <p>The other system., the system that we were working on we called Radical. No violence, no killing the bad guys, no taking their properties, no revolution—simply an alternative.</p>

<h1>No Boss</h1>
 <p>Then there was the question of replacing the boss. I had some experience with that and what came to popularly be known as self-management.</p>
 <p>But we came to realize that companies, a thing, do not have a self. Instead we called it co-management, because the team managed together. No need for a boss.</p>
 <p>But what about contributions. Bosses recognize them, although not always fairly.</p>

<h1>Recognized Contributions</h1>
 <h1>The co-author Adrian Perez and I experimented with how to recognize contributions. That was the one question, the fairness of it all, that came up very often at Nearsoft.</h1>

<h1>Distributions</h1>
 <p>At Nearsoft we reserved part of our profits for the following year’s operations and the rest we distributed equally among everybody. If there were 100 people and we had a $100 to distribute each of us got an extra dollar.</p>

<h1>Money</h1>
 <p>I think the problem was money, in particular the equal distribution go money.</p>
 <p>If we distributed carrots or potatoes it would not be a problem. Just eat them or give them away to friends and family. Money, on the other hand, is a universal mean of exchange. You can buy, for example, headphones with it. And that universality made different.</p>
 <p>So for Radical we came up with RADs, a percentage of the given RADs and without the baggage of money. You do something, other people recognize as a contribution, and they give you RADs.</p>
 <p>Later we realized that “recognized contribution” was the key. It got converted to RADs later. If you have 10% of the RADs, you get 10% of the profits.  If you 200 RADs and I have 100, you get twice the profits as I do.</p>
 <p>If you do not get what you think you think you deserve, you have to talk to a lot of other co-owners to learn why (there is no boss, remember).</p>

<h1>RADs!</h1>
 <p>We made an app to do the math (RADs! free in Apple and Android stores).</h1>
 <p>And we also made the RADs public.</p>

<h1>Ownership</h1>
<h1>Ownership &amp; Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Fiat ownership is exclusive,</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  &ldquo;I own it and you don&rsquo;t. Keep out of it!&rdquo;
 </div>
 <p>That is good for a toothbrush, but not for a business. Particularly not for a business whose growth comes from the work other people put in it.</p>
 <p>Today Fiat ownership is invisible. At  one time there might have been a reason for making it so.</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  This is mine. I took it by force and I will keep it by force. Even if I had to kill you, everyone in your family, and burn everybody in your village.
 </div>

<h1>Fiat Ownership</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>We are blind to.</li>
  <li>We do not question it.</li>
  <li>We even defend it.</li>
  <li>We give it sole credit for whatever progress we have made.</li>
  <li>The ultimate goal of most people in the Fiat system is to get as much money and power as possible.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>We Are Blind to It</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Economists sometimes get really close to it, but at the last minute they avoid it.</li>
  <li>Marx and his followers blame everything on ruthless capitalists, robber barons, and others bad people./li>
  <li>Others blame our problems on our veering away from the path of indigenous people, the simple people./li>
 </ul>
 <p>But it seems incomprehensible that we don’t see that Fiat ownership causes the majority of the harm we face, starting with poverty and excessive wealth.</p>

</h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership came out of our conversations. It is the kind of active property (e.g., a company, not a house) that belongs to all who contributes to it. If you see what we others do as a contribution and give us RADs for it, then you are a co-owner.</p>
 <p>There must be other ways to do it. For one, it has to come from a real contribution because 1) there are no bosses to kiss up to, and 2) capital does not constitute a contribution. For another, if the RADs given do not makes sense, other co-owners have the right and responsibility to ask.</p>

<h1>Ownership?</h1>
 <p>Many questions came up with co-ownership and we worked out many of them. I say most of them because we have our blind spots, too, but we trust that others will bring other shortcomings up later.</p>
 <p>The ownership of other things, too, will have to be worked out over time.</p>

<h1>Co-Management, &amp; Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Co-management has gone by &ldquo;self-management&rdquo; except a business has no self. So, we changed the name to co-management, because people, self included, can work without a boss.</p>
 <p>Note that co-management is not a flat organization or a patriarchy, or even a co-op.</p>

<h1>Capital or Contribution</h1>
 <p>Many people can make a contribution, though everybody can’t make a capital investment. So we came to a solution: a Radical Investment from a bank, from individuals, or even from a <em>Venture Capital firm</em>.</p>
 <p>Then we would sign a note saying that,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>We will return the principal,</li>
   <li>Plus a fixed percentage,</li>
   <li>Or a percentage of revenue,</li>
   <li>Or any other scheme</li>
   <li>A Radical Investment is never exchanged for power. You are free to do it, but it will very likely turn into a Fiat investment, a board, etc.</li>
   <li>And, of course, if the investment does not work out, that is that as far as the capital in Radical Investment. Just like any other investment.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>To note, I said we because we, all the co-owners, commit together. Maybe it can be done with a contract and multiple signatures, but we need to find a mechanism for all, or maybe a majority, of co-owners to commit.</p>

<h1>The RADs Mobile App</h1>
 <p>The RADs! mobile app has continued to evolve a lot. We have added a lot of things, taken off other things, and resolved a whole lot of issues.</p>
 <p>For example, as the name suggest we tried to let co-owners give RADs directly, but that did work so well. So we switched to recognized contributions. The output is converted to RADs (by an app) and can then be made tangible.</p>

<h1>The Future</h1>
<h1>RADs App&hellip;</h1>
 <p>The RADs app will continue to evolve. It is open to changes as you and I find mistakes and better solutions.</p>

<h1>No Dogma</h1>
 <p>There is nothing dogmatic here. It is only an alternative to Fiat. You are welcome to add things and change things, so long as it does not fold back into a Fiat system.</p>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>These are the blocks of the Foundation,</p>

 <p>But you are not going to get a demerit or a medal if you do not follow it, but if you are not careful you will have wasted time and end up back in the Fiat system.</p>
 <p>If it is working for all co-owners, go with. It is not, find another solution.</p>
