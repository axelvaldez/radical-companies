 <p>It is not &lsquo;breaking out&rsquo; or &lsquo;freedom.&rsquo; It is about helping people and their communities grow.</p>
</div>

<h1>Ownership is Freeing</h1>
  <ul>
   <li><em>Fiat ownership</em> applies to people who put up capital to own all or part of the business.</li>
   <li><em>Co-ownership</em> appplies to everyone who contributes to a company.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Jose Contreras</h1>
 <p>An example of contribution is Jose Contreras, a friend and co-owner of rEnchilada.</p>
 <p>He has an interesting background,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>He spent time in prison</li>
   <li>Soon after he got out of prison, he became the first employee of Nearsoft, a business that I had founded.</li>
   <li>From Nearsoft he went on to work for well-known companies.</li>
   <li>He writes poetry and has a facility with words.</li>
   <li>He is very creative and very quick on his feet.</li>
   <li>He came up with what became the <em>rEnchilada</em> to help people whowere struggling with sales and growth.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Staffing</h1>
  <p>rEnchila is going to staff up with underrepresented people (<em>e.g.</em>, brown people, black people, single mothers, ex-felons, etc) as co-owners.</p> We will experiment with it.</p>
 
<h1>rEnchilada</h1>
 <p>Jose&rsquo;s idea was to unify the sales process into a Sales Stack, an evidence-based process. Revenue growth with minimal fuzz and less expensive than doing it piecemeal as it is done today</p>
 <p>Our team,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Gets leads</li>
  <li>Calls/Email these leads</li>
  <li>Builds relationships with these leads</li>
  <li>Qualifies them</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Process?</h1>
 <p>Big companies may do this in-house. Smaller companies outsource some or all of these pieces.</p>
 <p>Jose&rsquo;s came with the idea to unify all of it into a single process. We work this process and we partner with our customers so they can learn it.</p>

<h1>Buthellip;</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>But &hellip; somebody must be doing it already!
 </div>
 <p>That my first reaction. I even looked around, but I came up empty handed.</p>
 <p>I talked to some of my friends in Sales and they pointed out that even in big companies there is no process. Sales is a sink or swim activity and what goes is whatever the sales people learned in their previous job. They have to make their financial quotas, and that is the thing that is measured.</p>
