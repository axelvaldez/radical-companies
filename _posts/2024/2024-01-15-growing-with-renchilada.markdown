 <p>It is not &lsquo;breaking out&rsquo; or &lsquo;freedom.&rsquo; It is about helping people and their communities grow.</p>
</div>

<h1>Ownership is Freeing</h1>
  <ul>
   <li>Fiat ownership applies to the <em><strong>a handful of people who put up capital</strong> to own the business.</em></li>
   <li>Co-ownership aappplies to <em><strong>everyone who contributes</strong> to a company.</em></li>
  </ul>

<h1>Jose Contreras</h1>
 <p>An example of contributin is Jose Contreras, a friend and co-owner of rEnchilada.</p>
 <p>He has an interesting background,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>He spent time in prison</li>
   <li>He was the first employee of the original Nearsoft, a business that I had co-founded.</li>
   <li>From Nearsoft he went on to work for well-known companies.</li>
   <li>He writes poetry and has a facility with words.</li>
   <li>He is very creative and very quick on his feet.</li>
   <li>He came up with what became the <em>rEnchilada</em> to help people.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Staffing</h1>
  <p>rEnchila is going to staff up with underrepresented people as co-owners (<em>e.g.</em>, brown people, black people, single mothers, ex-felons, etc).</p>
 
<h1>rEnchilada</h1>
 <p>Jose&rsquo;s idea was to unify the sales evidence-based process into a Sales Stack. That leads to revenue growth with minimal fuzz and less expensive than doing it piecemeal which is the way that is offered now or hiring a Sales team.</p>
 <p>Our teaam,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Gets leads</li>
  <li>Our Sales Development Reps (SDRs) builds a relatuionship with these leads
  <li>It calls these leads or emailing them</li?
  <li>They qualify them as <span class="iquo">ready to buy now.</span></li>
 </ul>
 <p>Big companies may do all of this in-house without a process. Smaller companies contract for each piece. But there is still the <em>no process</em>> problem. Jose&rsquo;s came with the idea is to unify all of that into a single process that flows. We work this process and then we work with our cstomers so they can learn it.</p>

<h1>But…</h1>
 <div class="_citation_">… somebody must be doing it already!</div>
 <p>That my first reaction. So I did look around, but I came up empty handed. I talked to some of my friends in Sales and they pointed out that even in big companies there is no process. Sales is a sink or swim activity and what goes is whatever the sales people learned in their previous job.</p>
 <p>Sales people have to make their financial quotas, and that is the only thing that what&rsquo;s measured.</p>
