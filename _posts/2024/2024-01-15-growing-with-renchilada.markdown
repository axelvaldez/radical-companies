 <p>It is not about &lsquo;breaking out&rsquo; or &lsquo;freedom.&rsquo; It is about helping people and their communities grow.</p>
</div>

<h1>Ownership is Freeing</h1>
  <ul>
   <li><em>Fiat ownership</em> applies to a handful of people who put up <strong>capital</strong> to own all or part of the business.</li>
   <li><em>Co-ownership</em> appplies to everyone who makes <strong>contributions</strong> to a company.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Jose Contreras</h1>
 <p>He has an interesting background,</p>
 <p>AJose Contreras is a good example of makig a contribution.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>He spent time in prison</li>
   <li>Soon after he got out of prison, he became the first employee of Nearsoft, a business that I had founded.</li>
   <li>From Nearsoft he went on to work for well-known companies.</li>
   <li>He writes poetry and has a facility with words.</li>
   <li>He is very creative and very quick on his feet.</li>
   <li>He came up with what became the <em>rEnchilada</em> to help people who were struggling with sales and growth.</li>
   <li>He wants to start Kite, an app that to help people with their need mental health.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Staffing</h1>
  <p>rEnchila is going to staff up with underrepresented people (<em>e.g.</em>, brown people, black people, single mothers, ex-felons, etc) as co-owners.</p>
 
<h1>rEnchilada</h1>
 <p>Jose&rsquo;s original idea was to unify the sales process into an evidence-based process we call Sales stac: revenue growth with minimal fuzz and less expensive than doing it piecemeal as it is done today</p>
 <p>Our team,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Gets leads</li>
  <li>Calls/Email these leads</li>
  <li>Builds relationships with these leads</li>
  <li>Qualifies them</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Process?</h1>
 <p>Big companies do this in-house, if they ndo itnat all. Smaller companies outsource these pieces.</p>
 <p>Jose&rsquo;s came with the idea to unify all of it into a single process. We work this process and we partner with our customers so they can learn it.</p>

<h1>But&hellip;</h1>
<p>My first reaction was &ldquo;But &hellip; somebody must be doing it already!&rdquo; I looked around, but I came up empty handed. I talked to some of my friends in Sales and they pointed out that even in big companies do not nave a process. Sales is a sink or swim activity and what goes is whatever the sales people learned in their previous job. They have to make their financial quotas, and that is the thing that is measured.</p>
<p>From my own experience, this had legs.
 <ul>
  <li>Founders end doing sales sporadically.</li>
  <li>Later they instituonalize it because, it had worked for them during the early stages and, hey, they are the boss. Eventually they bring in a vice President of Sales.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>It is time-consuming, and it gets very expensive over time.</li>
