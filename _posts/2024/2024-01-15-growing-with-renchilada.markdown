 <p>It is not &lsquo;breaking out&rsquo; or &lsquo;freedom.&rsquo; It is about helping people and their communities grow.</p>
</div>

<h1>Ownership is Freeing</h1>
  <ul>
   <li>Fiat ownership applies to the a handful of people who put up <em><strong>capital</strong></em> to own the business.</li>
   <li>Co-ownership aappplies to everyone who <em><strong>contributes</strong> to a company.</em></li>
  </ul>

<h1>Jose Contreras</h1>
 <p>An example of contributin is Jose Contreras, a friend and co-owner of rEnchilada.</p>
 <p>He has an interesting background,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>He spent time in prison</li>
   <li>He was the first employee of the original Nearsoft, a business that I had founded.</li>
   <li>From Nearsoft he went on to work for well-known companies.</li>
   <li>He writes poetry and has a facility with words.</li>
   <li>He is very creative and very quick on his feet.</li>
   <li>He came up with what became the <em>rEnchilada</em> to help people.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Staffing</h1>
  <p>rEnchila is going to staff up with underrepresented people (<em>e.g.</em>, brown people, black people, single mothers, ex-felons, etc) as co-owners.</p>
 
<h1>rEnchilada</h1>
 <p>Jose&rsquo;s idea was to unify the sales process into a Sales Stack, an evidence-based process, revenue growth with minimal fuzz and less expensive than doing it pieceme as it is done today</p>
 <p>Our team,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Gets leads</li>
  <li>Builds a relationship with these leads</li>
  <li>Calls/Email these leads</li>
  <li>Qualifies them</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Process?</h1>
 <p>Big companies may this in-house. Smaller companies outsource each or most of these pieces.</p>
 <p>But there is still the <em>no process</em>> problem. Jose&rsquo;s came with the idea to unify all of that into a single process that flows. We work this process and then we partner with our customers so they can learn it.</p>

<h1>Butâ€¦</h1>
 <div class="_citation_">&hellip; somebody must be doing it already!</div>
 <p>That my first reaction. I even looked around, but I came up empty handed. I talked to some of my friends in Sales and they pointed out that even in big companies there is beaurocracy, but there is no process. Sales is a sink or swim activity and what goes is whatever the sales people learned in their previous job. They have to make their financial quotas, and that is the thing that what&rsquo;s measured.</p>
