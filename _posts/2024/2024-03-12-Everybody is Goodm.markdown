 <p>I assume that from a very early age, everyboby wants to contribute. That is a radical assumption.</p>
 <p>I looked at Jean Piaget&rsquo;s <span class="quotespan">The Origins of Intellignce in Children<span>. It is an old book (I was five when he first published it)</p>
 <p>Its Sixth Stage, <span class="quotespan">The Invention of New Means Through Mental Combinations.</span> is significant to tnis assumpton because that is when what we recognize as intelligence appears. This happens at about the age of 2. It is still childish reinvention. It is at this stage that the child needs to also learn how communicate it to their coomunity, childish as it may be. Some parents do this brilliantly and most do badly or not all. <span class="quotespan">"Every child develops on their own timeline, but the best way to help develop your baby's language skills is to simply talk to them,</span> says Rahil Briggs, a child psychologist at The Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Montefiore in New York City.</p><span class="footnote"><a href="">1</a></span>
