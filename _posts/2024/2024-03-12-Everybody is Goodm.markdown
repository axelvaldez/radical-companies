 <p>I assume that from a very early age, everyboby wants to contribute. That is a radical assumption.</p>
 <p>I looked at Jean Piaget&rsquo;s <div class="quotespan">The Origins of Intellignce in Children</span>. It is a pretty old book. I was five when he first published it (I am 72 now).</div></p>
 <p>Its Sixth Stage, <div>The Invention of New Means Through Mental Combinations,</span> is significant, that is when as intelligence appears. This happens at about the age of 2. It is still childish reinvention, but you must pay attention./p>
 <p>It is at this stage that the child needs to also learn how to communicate it to their coomunity. Some parents do this brilliantly and most do it badly or not at all. class="footnote"><a href="">1</a></span>
