 <p>Everybody is trying to contribute (not sure about the mentally sick). For some, the mean is violence, for others, the mean is conversations.</p>

 <p>I assume that from a very early age, everyboby wants to contribute. That is a radical assumption.</p>
 <p>I looked at Jean Piaget&rsquo;s <span class="quotespan">The Origins of Intellignce in Children</span>. It is a pretty old book. I was five when he first published it (and I am 72 now).</p>
 <p>Its Sixth Stage, <span class="quotespan">The Invention of New Means Through Mental Combinations,</span> is significant, that is when as intelligence appears. This happens at about the age of 2. It is still childish reinvention.</p>
 <p>It is at this stage that the child needs to also learn how communicate it to their coomunity. Some parents do this brilliantly and most do it badly or not at all. class="footnote"><a href="">1</a></span>
