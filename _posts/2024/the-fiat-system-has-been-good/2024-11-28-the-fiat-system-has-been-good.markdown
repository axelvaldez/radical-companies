 <p>It is now time for an alternative.</p>
</div>

<h1>Fiat Has Not Been All Bad</h1>
 <p>The Fiat system has been good for more than a few people: it created the middle class, improved education, medicine, and science, etc. People in the US, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand and people of <em>European descent</em> do. Not all of them, mind you, but that is generally the case.</p>
 <p>Society has moved forward, in Europe and the &ldquo;<em>developed</em>&rdquo; countries.</p>

 <h1>Climate Change</h1>
  <p>Then there is Climate Change, <span id="_standout">which of course could be a hoax and the fires and destructive storms we are suffering through are just the result of our over stimulated imagination.</span></p>
  <p>Or it could be urgently true because Climat Change is already here.</p>
  <p id="_standout">But, hey, lets talk about it because we could be leaving money on the table.</p>

<h1>Money</h1>
 <p>But money should not be the priority. The priority must be people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
   <div class="_citation" >
    <p>&ldquo;Those poor people in Gaza, I feel for them,&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>So&hellip; what are you doing about it?</p>
   </div>
 <p>It is not,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Acts of charity and food for the homeless.</li>
   <li>Participation at a demonstration and maybe getting arrested.</li>
   <li>A revolution with blood on the streets (Marx failed).</li>
  </ul>
 <p>These are all features of the <em>Fiat system,</em></p>
  <ul>
   <li>Charity has never solved anything, but it feels good to the givers.</li>
   <li>Serving free food is an act of charity, which reinforces the believe that <em>the little people</em> are hepless even when it comes to feeding themselves.</li>
   <li>Revolutions change the people at the top who want their own flavor of a Fiat system.</li>
  </ul> 
 <p>We need at least one alternative with roots to make &ldquo;<em>people&rsquo;s lives</em>&rdquo; the highest priority. Lives with an impact, lives with a purpose, and lives with missions. We will have to changed more than a few minds, but once we have done so people will be on their way of fixing Climate and change and many of the other bad things that Fiat brings with it. We call that system <em>Radical</em>.</p>
