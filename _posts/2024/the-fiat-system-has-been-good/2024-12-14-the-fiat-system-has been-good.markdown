<h1>Too Complicated</h1>
 <p>The Fiat system has gotten too complicated for any one person to understand. That may be one of its defensive moves.</p>
 <p>Complex systems separate people into specialties and they waste time arguing with each other. It does not stop the future, but it slows it down.</p>

<h1>A Note</h1>
 <p>The Fiat system, like all systems, is implemented by people. They do not have to get in a room to plan the whole thing, the system just keeps preserving itself.</p>
 <p>Hats off to William the Conqueror, who started it all.</p>
