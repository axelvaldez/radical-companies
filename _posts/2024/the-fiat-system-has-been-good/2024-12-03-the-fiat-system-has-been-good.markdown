<h1></h1>
 <p>Fiat has been a positive force until about WWII.</p>
 <p>After the last big European war it became destructive. It first showed its good aspects, but then those same people created the destructive form of <em>imperialistic capitalism</em>. The capitalists did not all get in a room and decided to do evil, but they created the destructive aspects of it nontheless.</p>
 <p>They created a system to make money/capital/power <em>for individuals</em> by exploiting assets and people.</p>
 <p>That is why, I believe, that WWWII was the beginning of the end. The elements were there, we just combined them and industrialized them in our coat-and-tie uniforms. Fifteen years later, we got rid of the uniforms, but we continued to rob ourseles and Earth. Now we are forced to notice.</p>
 <p>Nobody knows what follows.</p>
