<h1>Progress&hellip; ?</h1>
 <p>Besides medicine, Fiat has brought progress to people&rsquo;s <em>comfort,</em></p>
  <ul id="_standout">
   <li>
    <p>The comfort of living in a house, worm in the winter with heating, cool with A/C in the summer.</p>
    <p>Never mind the homeless, they are in some sinful state, like drunkness or drug addiction.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Think of the job that exists today thanks to independant actors wanting to do better. You can &lsquo;blame&rsquo; that on the Fiat system, too.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Imagine AI. It is not going to replace people, any more than the mills replaced people. People just have to get re-trained, that is all.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Think of all the home conviniences for the benefits of house wives. Microwave ovens, expreso machines, intelligent ovens, and even intelligent toasters. Men are befiting from these! And people that do not have those, want them and will work multiple jobs or go into debt to get them.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Imagine debt, conveniently accumulated in credit cards. &ldquo;Buy now, pay later.&ldquo;</p>
    <p>Eventually you will be forced to pay because upright citizens always do so. Otherwise, you will end up in trouble that you brought upon yourself.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Think of transportation. Everybody has a car; well, almost everybody. The very poor and the homeless do not or else they would not be so poor and destitute.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Think of the roads to you job. Those are public goods (provided by taxes that you dutifully paid).</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <p id="_standout">They are the benefits of the Fiat system, although some people may fall outside of it, just look at the shithole countries.</p>
