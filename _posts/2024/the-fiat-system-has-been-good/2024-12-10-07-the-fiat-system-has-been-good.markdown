<h1></h1>
 <p>Here is what I meant by &lsquo;slavery&rsquo;&hellip;</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>In the not-so-good old days, slavery was temporary to a harvest, to a person, to a village. &ldquo;I won over you as my enemy, so you are now my slave for the next harvest.&ldquo;</p>
 <p>Then came (Anglo, Spanish, and Portugues) Americas, and slavery was industrialized. It was generationally. you know, <span id="_standout">like cows</span></p>
 <p>And these were not the result of won battles, these slaves were imported from West Africa. The English, the Spanish, and the Portuguese made a lot of money this way,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The Portuguese in Brazil kept villages together.</li>
   <li>The Spanish kept families together.</li>
   <li>The US did not care for villages of families, they sold each enslaved person to the highest bidder.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Regardless, families and villages were broken over time in all territories. For example, women and children were sold individually.</p>

<h1>Slavery Made Illegal</h1>
 <p>Then Europe made slavery illegal and eventually at least the exporting business stopped, but in the US a war was fought instead between the old-fashioned slaver States and the new-fashioned slaver States.</p>
 <p>The new-fashioned States did not see it as slavery. The new system was so efective that it has lasted to this day, and will probably last longer.</p>
 <p>The war came about because the Northern States and the Southern States were not listening to each other, they were yelling at each other.</p>
 <p>The Northern States called it <em>freedom</em> instead of <em class="_standout">New, Improved Slavery</em>. Improved because it applied to Africans <em>and</em> Europeans. Slaves to their survival and that survival came in the form of low wages.</p>
 <p>And that is why I refer to jobs as slavery,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You stop working, and eventually you will be in the poor house.</li>
   <li>Instead of slavery to one owner, you were enslaved to your survival.</li>
   <li>Fiat owners &lsquo;helped&rsquo; by offering a job.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>The Fiat system does not care, so long as money accumulation happened no matter how many hands it ended up in. The employees themselves tried to get rich, and many have. They had to bring the <em>people with capital</em> into the deal. It was new form of getting richer, this time through <em>entrepreneurship</em>.</p>
