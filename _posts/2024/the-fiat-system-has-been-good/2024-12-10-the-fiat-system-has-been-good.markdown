<h1></h1>
 <p>Here is what I meant by &ldquo;<em>slavery</em>&rdquo; &hellip;</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>In the not-so-good old days, slavery was temporary to a harvest, to a person, to a village. &ldquo;I won over you as my enemy, so you are now my slave for the next harvest.&ldquo;</p>
 <p>Then came (Spanish, Anglo, and Portugues) to the Americas, and slavery was industrialized. It was generationally. y&rsquo;know, <span id="_standout">like cows.</span></p>
 <p>And these were not the result of won battles, these slaves were imported mostly from West Africa. The Spanish, the English, and the Portuguese made a lot of money this way.</p>
 <p>But there differeces,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The Portuguese in Brazil kept villages together.</li>
   <li>The Spanish kept families together.</li>
   <li>The US did not care for villages of families, they sold each enslaved person to the highest bidder.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Regardless, families and villages were broken over time in all territories. For example, women and children were sold individually.</p>

<h1>Slavery Made Illegal</h1>
 <p>Then Europeans made slavery illegal and eventually the &ldquo;<em>business</em>&rdquo; stopped.</em></p>
 <p>In the US a war was fought instead between the <em>old-fashioned slaver</em> Southern States and the <em>wage-slaver</em> Nortern States. In fact, the Northern States did not see it as <em>slavery</em> and called it &ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; because it applied to Africans <em>and</em> Europeans who were enslaved to their survival. In fact, Fiat owners were &lsquo;saviors&rsquo; by offering a job.</p>
 <p>The system has been so efective that it continues to this day (and will probably last longer).</p>
