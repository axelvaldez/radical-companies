 <p>The Itsum Story</p>
</div>

<h1>Meaning & Belonging</h1>
 <p>Like all Itsums, Meaning put himself together from pieces left on the floor.</p>
 <p>Meaning wanted to underdant his motivations and wht brought him to doone thing versus another</p>
 <p>Then Belonging put himself together from the pieces that he believed would make him more sensitive to other Itsums and what they wanted (not what they said).</p>
 <p>Itsums Meaning and Belonging became very close friends. They were buddies with many other Itsums, including Fiat.</p> 

<h1>Decentralization & Transparency</h1>
 <p>Decentralization had been around for a while, always teaching alternatives to Itsums that always wanted somebody to tell what to do.</p>
 <p>Transparenvy was hard to see, but when Decentralization met Tansparency they knew they were <em>compas</em>.</p>

<h1>Experiment</h1>
 <p>Itsum <em>Experiment</em> was always in <em>Let&rsquo;s-Try</em> mode. In fact, the reality is that we are always <em>doing things from scratch</em>.</p>
 <p>Experiment knew it as it picked pieces to make himself. He was eager.</p>
 <p>He thought about it a lot before picking up a piece. And he would discard a piece just as easily as he picked it up.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Do I feel more adventurous?&rdquo; If not, it would discard that piece and pick another one.</p>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>These five Itsums, Meaning, Belonging, Decentralization, Transparency, and Experimenting came together and created the Radical Foundation to give Itsums a guide to stay on the healthy path.</p>
 <p>From them come everything Radical.</p>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Co-management, often known as self-management means <em>no managers</em>. The people working toegether as a company manage <em>the work</em> themselves.</p>
 <p>If mom or dad are managers, they can be part of a <em>Fiat Business</em> and continue as managers.</p>
 <p>If they join a <em>Radical Company</em> they can work on&hellip; anything they want, as long as their team knows.</p>
 <p>Co-ownership is the next step: <em>no owners</em>. People accumulate ownership as they contribute to what everybody works towards.</p>
 <p>The Fiat system cannot deal with co-ownership. The Radical House is co-owned by all the Itsums. They have to collaborate to get things done. They each has to speack up if something sounds &ldquo;funny.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>RADs</h1>
 <p>Your contributions gets converted to RADs. This way they can be converted to money, candy, and toys.</p>
