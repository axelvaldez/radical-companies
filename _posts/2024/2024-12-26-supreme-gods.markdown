 <p>According to history, the Supreme God (Ahura Mazda) stuff started with Zarathushtra Spitama (better known as Zoroaster), in Persia.</p>

 <p>This is a very brief review of of Bichler and Nitzam paper.</p>

<h1>Supreme God</h1>
 <p>The term <em>Supreme God</em> <a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> refers to a celestial hierarchical power above all the other Gods (first coined by Friedrich Schelling, although I picked it up from the Bichler and Nitzam paper).</p>
 <p>The Supreme God religions has lasted to this day, in fact, includingn Judaism. Christianity, and Islam.xx</p>
 <p>Countries and businesses adopted the pattern and it has worked very well for them.</p>

<h1>Private Armies</h1>
 <p>Their paper brings up the rise of private armed forces and the authors take a very dark view of it, as we all should. They write that private armies will keep getting more and more powerful and this will lead to oligarchic States.</p>
 <p>This is a well researched paper and the data they analyzed certaily points to that conclusion. But the past is not a <em>prediction</em> of the future,so let&rsquo;s instead take this as a warning.</p>
 <p>Private armed forces have been around forever. For example, US President Ronald Reagan had them and Russia&rsquo;s dictator Vladimir Putin has them. Some politicians (<em>e.g.</em>, Donald Trump) may have aspirations of creating an authoritarian goverment in the US, but I am not betting on it.</p>
