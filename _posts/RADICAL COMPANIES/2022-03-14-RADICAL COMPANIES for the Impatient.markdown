<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:7ex; margin:40px 0 20px 0; ">Strictly for the Impatient</h1>

 <h2>Businesses Run as Dictatorships Hurt Us</h2>
 <p>Our deepest problems are the inescapable side-effects of the system we live in, a system based on domination: our collapsing climate, the gaping wealth gap, discrimation against people of color, the exploitation of women. We need a generative way of relating to one another, a different paradigm. As we see it, companies are the place to start, they are the appropriate incubators for what comes next.</p>
 <p>Nature follows a simple path to create big beautiful things out of unpretentious, small ones. From tiny seed to mighty oak tree. We don’t think that a long list of principles or color scales or a 17 page constitution are necessary to make a fundamental change. Eventually, these can become dogma, a form of force, and get in the way.</p>
 <p> With that in mind, we came up with what we think are the most basic foundations to support our coming together to share work and wealth.</p>

 <h2>An Easy-to-Remember Foundation for a <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> Companies</h2>
 <p>In the RADICAL world, a company is what we call a group of people who come together to build something bigger than themselves. In fact, the word "company" come from the Latin prefix <em>con-</em>, meaning together, and <em>pan</em>, meaning bread: people who break bread together.</p>
 <p>Every company is different because the people who embody it are different, and every company must find its own way. What fundamentally makes a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> company different from a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">FIAT</SPAN> business is that it starts from a simple foundation of interdependence,</p>

 <p>Other practices can be layered on top of these, but for a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> company these are essential, otherwise it is just a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">FIAT</SPAN> business with ain’t-we-nice sprinkled on top.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Will this reduce the autonomy of people to find meaning? (<em>e.g.</em>, "This is has be done by&hellip;&nbsp;")</li>
  <li>Are we taking people's autonomy to determine who they work work with? (<em>e.g.</em>, pre-assigned "teams")</li>
  <li>Will this makes more or less centralized? (<em>e.g.</em>, having an entitled subcomitee)</li>
  <li>Will this decision make us more or less transparent? (<em>e.g.</em>, predetermining budgets)</li>
  <li>Does this go agains our agreed upon alignment? (<em>e.g.</em>, "We have to do this for a little while&hellip;&nbsp;")</li>
  <li>Are we allowing for experimentation? (<em>e.g.</em>, "This has to meet these requirement <em>and</em> it has to be done this way&hellip;&nbsp;")</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Unlike in a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">FIAT</SPAN> business, a hierarchy is not imposed in a co-managed company. The hierarchies that do emerge are dynamic, fluid, and shaped by what's needed and by the people involved.</p>

 </pre>

 <h2>Alignment Must Be Explicit and Transparent</h2>
 <p>In order to create a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> company, we first need to be explicit about the company’s IMPACT  (<em>i.e.</em>, <em>what for</em>), its PURPOSE (<em>i.e.</em> why), and MISSION (<em>e.g.</em>,its <em>what</em>, <em>how</em>, and <em>when</em>). You might call them something different or you might lump tje, in different ways. No matter, they have to be explicit and completely open and accessible to everyone.</p>
 <p>The three-finger Scout Salute<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> is a good mnemonic for it,</p>
 <pre style="font-family: courier new; text-align: center; border: silver dotted 1px; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px; ">
  <img src="/assets/img/en-alignment.svg" alt="Three middle fingers up, as in the Scout Salute, serves as a mnemonic for the three elements of alignment: the middle finger stands for IMPACT, the index finger for PURPOSE, and the ring finger for MISSION" title="Elements of Alignment" style="width: 80%; ">
 </pre>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>Impact is our beacon, a clear point of light just over the horizon that guides us. This is what many call Vision but we wanted to put more emphasis on the <em>impact</em> that vision will have on the world.</p>
   <p>Dave Logan, lead author of <em>Tribal Leadership</em>, used to call it Noble Cause, but these days he prefers to call it Noble Passion. As he puts it, “… a noble cause gets you out of bed. A noble passion gets you out of bed early and keeps you up late into the night.”<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>Purpose is the reason why we, as a company, are focused on this particular Impact. It doesn't have to be world shaking and it doesn't have to strum your heart’s strings. An effective Purpose must clearly express <em>why</em> it is important for others to join us in this adventure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>The Mission defines <em>what</em> we are going to do to move towards the Impact, <em>how</em> we are going to do it, and by <em>when</em>. This is a conversation, live, dynamic conversation where everybody who wants to can participate. It is not "suggestions" sent by email to somebody else who is going to select by popularity or any such.And, yes, there are many ways to do it with 50, 1,00, or 10,000 people.</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>This is but one way to express alignment. The important thing is to make it explicit, simple, and meaningful to ,<em>everybody</em> in the team.</p>
<br>

<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:7ex; margin:40px 0 20px 0; "><spen style="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</spen> Distribution</h1>
<p>The Distribution mechanism we describe below makes ownership decentralized and dynamic. It supports egalitarian and equitable wealth sharing based on contribution. And it is scalable.</p>

 <h2>Inspiration: The Rosedale Distribution</h2>
  <p>Rosedale Distribution<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> is our name for a practice that I first heard from entrepreneur Philip Rosedale,
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>As the company grows, a small amount of cash and shares are put out for distribution every month.
   </li>
   <li>Every member gets, say, $1,000, an equal portion of the wealth the company generated.
   </li>
   <li>People don’t get to keep these goodies for themselves: they get to distribute them to other members.
   </li>
   <li>They give it to anybody they feel has contributed the most during the month. Each person knows best who has contributed.
   </li>
   <li>Each person decides how much to give to whom based on whatever criteria “feels right” at that time.
   </li>
  </ul>

 <h2>The <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> Distribution Difference</h2>
  <p>Instead of cash or stocks, <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> Distribution uses a dimensionless unit we call a <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>. Whereas money has a <em>fixed</em> value, RADs <em>factor</em> value through them. Whereas stocks represent a fixed percentage of the company <em>forever</em>, <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s represent a dynamic <em>percentage</em> of ownership<em> at each cycle</em>.</p>
  <p>RADs represent any kind of contribution, not just financial. In fact, as an accounting tool, <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s account for the unaccountable.</p>
  <p>Co-owners then get to distribute RADs according to their individual judgment. Each decides what is an <em>equitable</em> number of <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s to give to other co-owners as recognition for their contributions. The value of the whole emerges from the judgment of the many.</p> 
  <p>A few important observations,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>RADs are not a currency.</li>
   <li><SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s are issued even before there is revenue because contributions happen regardless of revenue.</li>
   <li>The giving criteria is completely up to each person, although we can agree to some explicit guiding criteria to start with. In any case, at every Distribution Retrospective new criteria are fleshed out and harvested as an optional guideline.</li>
   <li><SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s represent <em>dynamic</em> ownership. One month you may give me all your <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s, but the next month you may not give me any.</li>
   <li>The absolute number of <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s allocated to me either stays the same or goes up at every distribution. If I had 100 <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s last cycle and I get 50 this cycle, my total number of <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s goes to 150. If I don’t get any this cycle, my total number of <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s stays at 100.</li>
   <li>On the other hand, my percentage of the total could go up, stay the same, or go down at every Distribution. If my 100 <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s represented 10% of the total last cycle and I get 150 <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s this cycle, then my percent ownership went up to 12.5%; if I get 100 new <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s, my percentage stays at 10%; if don’t get any new <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s, my percentage goes down to 5%.</li>
   <li>To calculate your percentage ownership, divide the number of <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s you have been allocated by the total number of allocated <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s.</li>
   <li>When money, or time, or whatever else is disbursed later, it is done as a function of the number of <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s each person owns. If you have accumulated 200 <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s and I have 100, then you’ll get twice as much as me of whatever is being factored through the <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There probably are many ways of doing this,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Every cycle each member gets to distribute a number of <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s as they see fit. For example, if you get 100 <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s this month, you may give fifty to Adrian, 30 to Jose, and 20 to me.
   </li>
   <li>Alternatively, co-owners might get one <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s per day. They could then allocate fractions of this one <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>. One tenth to Adrian, 0.01 to Jose, and 0.001 to me.
   </li>
   <li>We may have Distribution events once a month, where everybody participates. Alternatively, you may do your allocations daily and I may do them once a month. Or maybe you start daily and then skip a few days before you allocate again.
   </li>
   <li>Your unallocated <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s may disappear every day or they may accumulate for a month or a year.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The RADICAL Distribution is Scalable</h3>
  <p>People are the best judges of <em>who</em> should be recognized and <em>what</em> should be recognized as a contribution,</p>

  <p>As people share and grant each other <span>RAD</span>s, they learn the value of what they’ve built together at a visceral level. People will be encouraged to learn to communicate better (“It ain't bragging if you've done it”<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>). They will learn from their peers to value their accomplishments. They will learn to talk about their failures, what they've learned from them, and how it can be valuable to others.</p>
  <h3>The RADICAL Distribution Includes Banners</h3>
   <p>Recognition is really important to both the giver and the receiver. Whether as individuals or as a team, having our accomplishments recognized by others is very important and precious to people.
   </p>
   <p>Distribution Banners can stand for teams, special accomplishments, communities, new products, etc.

      <p>For a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> company the equivalent thing would be to put up a “20%” Banner and co-owners could allocate RADs to it as they see fit. Or more specifically, a “Google News” Banner could fund that specific project.</p>

      <p>In a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> company, anybody can put up a “New building” Banner for co-owners to contribute to the funding of it or not.</p>

  <h3<span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> Includes Retrospectives</h3>
   <p>At a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> Retrospective, members discuss the criteria they used to allocate RADs. Participation in these Retrospectives is voluntary and members can share as much or as little of their criteria as they like. These do not prevent people from making their own decisions, but it serves as a guide.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> Distribution Includes Feedback</h3>
   <p>Anybody who wants to can call for a feedback session after a Distribution. In particular, people who didn’t get anything or significantly less than they expected would want to do this. It might be difficult to hear the feedback, but it’s the way to grow. It can help resolve latent tensions, correct wrong impressions, and get better results in the future.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> Distribution Is Transparency</h3>
   <p>We don’t think that <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> Distributions will work without complete transparency. In theory, the allocator and recipient could block their identity or the number of <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s allocated, but that is fear speaking, limiting our options. We don’t think that anything less than full disclosure will work.</p>
   <p>Of course, you’ll have to figure out what works for you, but hiding any of this information is likely to turn out to be a failure.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-size:smaller; ">RAD</span>s Account for the Unaccountable</h3>
   <p><span style="font-size:smaller; ">RAD</SPAN>s represent many things other than simple financial value. They are not beans, but they can be counted.</p>
   <p>The <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s you have represent how other people feel about you and how they value your contributions. If you are making us miserable, you’ll probably get fewer <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s from us; if you are helping us thrive, you’ll likely get more. If you do something that goes against our Impact, “but, hey, it makes money,” you’ll get less <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s; if instead you introduce a way to make money <em>and</em> strengthen our alignment, you’ll get more <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s.</p>
   <p>In short, <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s account for the uncountable, they measure the immeasurable.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:7ex; margin:40px 0 20px 0; "><span style="font-size: smaller; ">RADICAL</span> Wealth Extraction</h1>
 <p>You can calculate the amount each co-owners have earned by factoring the total revenue through the allocated <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>s. For example,
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Six of us generate $16,000 in dividends.
  </li>
  <li>There is a total of 1,000 RADs allocated which means that each <SPAN>RAD</SPAN> is worth $16 this cycle.
  </li>
  <li>You have 450 allocated RADs and I have 130.
  </li>
  <li>You <em>earned</em> $7,200 and I’ve <em>earned</em> $2,080 of the total dividends.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>That earned amount is split between Dividends and a Predictable Recurring Income component.
 </p>

 <h2>Making Recurring Takehome Pay Predictable</h2>
   <p>When you really think about it, “salary” is a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">FIAT</SPAN> tool. Employees get a more or less predictable wage in exchange for doing as the boss says. Salaries, such as they are today, do not quite fit in the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> context.</p>
   <p>The PRI is what every co-owner takes home every period (<em>e.g.</em>, biweekly, monthly),</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Each member determines their Predictable Recurring Income (PRI). This is what they need to take home every month.</li>
    <li>Along with expenses, loan repayment, and other fixed expenses, the sum of all PRIs determines what for simplicity we’ll call the company’s breakeven point.</li>
    <li>Every month, the company pays its bills and all PRIs and what’s left is distributed as Earned Dividends according to each person’s <SPAN>RAD</SPAN>  allocations. This is the happy path.</li>
    <li>When revenue doesn’t cover the breakeven point, a PRI Account for each member provides predictability. As a company we can get a loan or  an investment for this fund. Then, as needed, money flows out of the PRI Account to cover a member’s full PRI.</li>
    <li>Each co-owner is responsible for her PRI Account and has to pay back what they got out of it. Most likely, this will be paid back out of Earned Dividends once revenue goes above breakeven, but this is something you’d have to experiment with.</li>
    <li>In the worst case, if the company goes belly up, then if the PRI Account was funded with investment money, there’s no “debt” to be paid back. If it was funded with a loan, then people with unpaid balances have to make good on that loan.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The PRI functions a lot like a salary,  </p>
   <ul>
    <li>If I earned <em>more</em> than my PRI, then I can take home my PRI <em>and my Earned Dividends</em>.</li>
    <li>If what I’ve earned matches my PRI, then I take that much home.</li>
    <li>If I earned <em>less than my PRI</em>, I still take home <em>the amount of money I expected</em>, because the PRI Account makes up the difference, but I now owe the difference to the PRI Account.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>You’ll have to experiment with how these debts are settled. At its loosest, I could pay that debt “later” (<em>e.g.</em>, out of my future Earned Dividends). At its most rigid, I’d have to pay the PRI Account debt, plus interest, within 60 days. Our suggestion, as always, is to go for a policy that matches peoples' needs and situation. If a problem crops up, then tweak the policy as appropiate. In any case, don’t yield to imagined fears.</p>
   <p>In the example below, Salim, Daliah, Alicia, and Anita earned enough dividends to cover their full Predictable  Recurring Income (PRI); Kim and Julio earned less than their PRI, so money flows out of the <em>PRI Account</em> to make up the difference, but they now owe this much to the <em>PRI Account</em>.</p>
   <p style="font-family: courier new; font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: 75%; border: silver dotted 1px; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px; ">
    <img src="/assets/img/en-predictable-recurring-income-pri-t0.svg" alt="A table and a graph. The table has two rows and six columns. The first row is labeled RADs and the second row PRIs.

   </p>
   <p>We had a lot of back and forth over the PRI Account being a <em>personal</em> debt. Why not have it be a shared debt? The problem is that this may work for small groups, but it doesn’t scale well. In a large group, it would make co-owners responsible for debt accumulated by people they don’t know. They would want to know things like “Why is Julio’s PRI so high?” On the other hand, as a personal debt, everybody can figure out what works for them and decide accordingly. Maybe Julio doesn’t feel good about going into so much debt and brings down his PRI after realizing that he had jacked it up out of unexamined fears. Or maybe he is helping pay for his sister’s school and is willing to bear the debt for a while longer.</p>
   <p>If you are thinking that this process takes a lot of time, you’re right. But it is cheaper and healthier than  leaving tension to fester. That anger and bottled up frustration translates to less engaged people and less trust within the team. This is very expensive and very unhealthy in the long-term (and even in the short-term).</p>

 <h2>Dividends Are Not a Gift, You Earned Them</h2>
   <p>Below there are three sample scenarios for how Earned Dividends are calculated,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Below breakeven: When we as a company don’t generate enough Dividends to cover everybody’s PRIs in full and the difference has to come out of the PRI Accounts.</li>
    <li>At breakeven: When we make enough to at least pay everybody’s PRI.</li>
    <li>Above breakeven: When we as a company can pay everybody’s PRI <em>and</em> disburse Earned Dividends.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>This first scenario is what normally happens at the start of a company: it doesn’t generate enough revenue to cover everybody’s PRI. In this case, we would need a cash infusion to the PRI Account so we can use it to meet the amount of PRI each person has set.</p>

   <p>In the breakeven case we finally get to pay ourselves fully from the revenue that we’ve generated. Even in this case, some people may need to draw from the Predictable Recurring Income (PRI) Account, maybe because their PRI are high, or their RADs are low, or both.

   <p>At some point, after we’ve been steadily growing our revenue, no money is coming out of our Predictable Recurring Income (PRI). This is when we start disbursing Earned Dividends in addition to covering everybody’s PRI.

   <p>Notice that even though dividends are up, Julio continues to draw from the PRI Account because his PRI is pretty high and his RAD count is pretty low. He may want to change his PRI or get feedback on why his <SPAN style="font-size:smaller; ">RAD</SPAN>s are so low.

 <h2>Comparing the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> Investment Model with that of Banks and VCs</h2>
   <p><span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> investments will, at worst, have the same financial yield as today’s VC system, but with 1) a lot more beneficiaries (<em>i.e.</em>, all the co-owners), and 2) less risk (<em>i.e.</em>, because a lot more people will be committed to making it work).</p>

    <img src="/assets/img/bank-vs-vcs-vs-radical.svg" alt="Two graphs. The one on the left has RISKS on the horizontal axis and YIELD on the vertical axis. BANKS defines a small horizontal parallelogram, it's dot is about     one fifth of the way into the RISKS axis and one tenth of the way up the YIELD axis. VC defines a square, it's dot is a little over half way into the RISKS axis and half way up the YIELD axis. RADICAL defines a large vertical parallelogram, with its dot at a little less than half way into the RISKS axis and nine tenth of the way up
    the YIELD axis. The RADICAL box shows a hashed square area which highlights the fact that the RADICAL approach provides much more YIELD than the BANKS or VC approaches.    The graph on the right has RISKS on the horizontal axis and BENEFICIARIES on the vertical axis. As in the previous graph, BANKS defines a small horizontal parallelogram. VC defines a horizontal parallelogram, with it's dot appears seven tenth of the way into the RISKS axis and one fourth of the way up the YIELD axis. As in the previous graph, RADICAL defines a large vertical parallelogram. The RADICAL box shows a hashed area which highlights the fact that the RADICAL approach BENEFITS many more people than the BANKS or VC approaches. " title="Comparing Banks, VCs, and RADICAL.">
