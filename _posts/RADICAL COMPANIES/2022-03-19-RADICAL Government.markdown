<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In the book <a href="https://radicals.world/fDm2e">RADICAL COMPANIES</a>, we
considered how the RADICAL model would work in a company environment. Other than
a mention here and there, we said next to nothing about money, land, or
governments.
</p>
<p>
In <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rqcL9sLPAgUs5KmiI_F-Qtr5q0V2LZjxXELYgj6ZXu8/edit#heading=h.gqizizpnpgzu"><span style="font-size: smaller; ">COIN</span></a>, I laid out my ideas about money and what it would look like in a decentralized, transparent world. In <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ZJWvCbxfhz4qtwhRr678nLyWPhn-zKWuD590yqQsJ0/edit#heading=h.gdgppswdot76"><span style="font-size: smaller; ">LAND</span></a>, I put down my thoughts on how land would be handled in a RADICAL world.
</p>
<p>
In this document I finally get to lay down some my thoughts, albeit unpolished,
about government.
</p>

<h2>Very Different</h2>
<p>
National governments are the ultimate centralized power. Dictatorships are the
most centralized, and democratic governments the least, but they all centralize
power. They have a monopoly on force: national governments run the military and
state governments and cities run police forces.
</p>
<p>
In the RADICAL model, governments would not be able to collect taxes since the
moral equivalent of land taxes go directly into local community funds and only a
trickle of it goes to more centralized centers of power.
</p>
<p>
In any case, in the RADICAL model society’s governance would be decentralized
and not like today’s national governments. RADICAL societal governance will be
based on scarcity and competition as it is in the FIAT system.
</p>

<h2>City Government</h2>
<p>A local government must be granted power by the State. This is probably a
leftover from the days of Royalty, where the rules had to issue a charter (and
charged for doing so).
</p>
<p>
City governments are responsible for,
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The police force, fire abatement, paramedic help.</li>
 <li>Traffic infrastructure (<em>e.g.</em>, signs, speed zones).</li>
 <li>Local city road construction and maintenance, including public parking for cars and motorcycles.</li>
 <li>Building regulations and zoning.</li>
 <li>Keeping water clean and maintaining sewer lines.</li>
 <li>Waste removal.</li>
 <li>Parks and recreation.</li>
 <li>Municipal courts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing that our present day’s cities get involved in is economic development. Let’s start with that because that is where the wheels of “government of the people, by the people, for the people” start to come off.
</p>

<h3>Economic Development</h3>
<p>
“Economic development” is where elected government goes over the line and gets
involved in the creation of private goods for businesses and their owners in the
name of “job creation.” In a RADICAL world, city governments are no longer
responsible for any of this—everybody is capable and has the means to build
their own wealth creating communities.
</p>

<h3>Car Traffic</h3>
<p>Let’s take traffic next. I predict that all things traffic are going to change dramatically, very quickly. As I write this, <a href="https://getcruise.com">CRUISE</a> launched a driverless, Uber-like service in San Francisco. It won’t take long before its price comes down to the point that it will not make sense for individuals to own cars, and house cars, and loiter the streets with parked cars. Eventually, a car can own itself. Autonomous cars will house themselves out of sight throughout an urban area and there  won’t be cars parked on the side of roads, and.
</p>
<p> The next development is to have intra-vehicle communication. With that and the sensor in every vehicle, we won’t need traffic lights or signage.
</p>
<p>So, take all things traffic off the city’s todo list.
</p>

<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
<p>
Local city road construction and maintenance remains a task that somebody has to
be responsible for, at least, coordinating. Imagine a company whose “product” is
the public good, with expertise of where the roads are needed, and whose
“performance” would then be measured via RADs.
</p>
<p>
The actual construction of the roads would be 1) funded by the community that
needs it and 2) built by companies that have expertise in doing so and are
highly valued by the communities that finance them (again, as measured by RADs).
</p>
<p>
Parks and recreation are very similar, with people responsible for
<em>coordinating</em> planning and construction. Ditto for water purification.
</p>
<p>
A few things off the list.
</p>

<h3>Zoning and Building Regulations</h3>
<p>
Zoning strikes me as a weak way to try and control the worst tendencies of FIAT
landowners. But keeping the “bad” buildings away from the residential buildings
is not harmless, either, and it is not a solution, either. I’d rather trust each
hyper-local community, people who know each other, to make those decisions using
the RADICAL system rather than a city government.
</p>
<p>
There might be a coordinating function needed as well as expertise but that can
be handled by RADICAL companies.
</p>
<p>
Off the list.
</p>

<h3>Higiene: Waste Removal</h3>
<p>City governments already contract with private companies to do the removal work.
Individual RADICAL communities can do this easily, with transparency providing
the coordinating function.

<h3>Municipal Courts</h3>
<p>
“Crime” in a RADICAL community would be the exception and probably driven by
mental imbalances that would be better taken care of by communities with the
help of people who specialize in this kind of situation.
</p>
<p>
Disputes could mostly be handled by the communities itself, with the help of
people who specialize in this kind of situation.
</p>

<h3>Police, Fire, Paramedic</h3>
<p>
The first thing to note about the police is that it is <em>a force</em>,
carrying lethal weapons. They <em>fight</em> criminals, people who don’t abide
by the rules and would harm the rest of us, well behaved citizens. We want them
to do a lot besides that: caretakers and givers, arbiters, the calmest person in
the room and the most aggressive person in the room. In the face of all these
conflicting roles, they often default to the threat of violence and violence
itself. I doubt that there’d be a need for specialized police—people would do
most of it—but even if there is, it would be very different than it is today.
</p>
<p>
Fire abatement has been around for a long time. At the beginning putting out
fires was a paid FIAT business, “you have to pay before we put out the fire.”
Eventually it became a public service. I imagine that fire abatement,
paramedics, and disaster help would all come as a service paid for Banners.
</p>

<h2>County Government</h2>
<p>
These take care of school districts independent of cities. They also handle many
city-like functions for unincorporated areas.
</p>

<h2>State Government</h2>
<p>
The main function of State government seems to be standing in the way of what
progressive cities want to do or pushing conservative cities to do something
they don’t really want to. Other than that, they handle water harvesting and
distribution, the State police, and its National Guard.
</p>
<p>
Whatever we said about police, above, applies to the State police and National
Guard.
</p>

<h3>Water: Urban vs Farm</h3>
<p>
Water is a good case to think through. Residential water versus irrigation water
is a fight that has been going on in California for a long time. Central Valley
versus coastal areas. Producers versus consumers. Talking points that go
straight for the emotional buzzer. And really the whole thing is about who is
going to rule water? The State government is lef’s to compromise, either where
nobody outright wins or the winner is obfuscated. That’s the FIAT way.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t thought about what this would look like under a RADICAL model.
</p>

<h2>National Government</h2>
<p>
I don’t see any user for national governments, long term.
</p>
<p>
Maybe, bigger things like the Space Station and planetary research may remain in
the hands of a government-like team.
</p>

<h2>Worth Repeating</h2>
<p>
This may be a difficult read and it may be worth repeating here a few words
about the RADICAL framework and how it’s different from our current world.
Probably the most confusing thing about it is that a RADICAL world would be very
similar to our current world. People will be the same with all our jealousies,
overreactions, and habits. They will be embarrassed by overpromising and want to
sweep under the proverbial rug.
</p>
<p>
The only difference—the big difference—is that the RADICAL system is centered
around our interdependence.
</p>
<p>
Our current system is based on separating us: countries, towns, good and bad
neighborhoods; political parties and their vastly different realities; need to
know, secrecy, protection. This leaves us disconnected and drives us to
isolation. Businesses are built on creating platforms to bring us back together,
for a fee. This works for a world where money comes first, ahead of everything
else.
</p>
<p>
A RADICAL world, too, is centered around accomplishments and real innovation,
but it prioritizes what’s important to people first, ahead of everything else,
including money. We’ll still be individuals, with our own needs, rights, and
idiosyncrasies. We are not going to become a number. The RADICAL model is
centered on trust, the type that comes from community and collaboration.
</p>

<h2>The Three Branches</h2>
<p>
Throughout the stuff above, there is a general disregard for the separation of
powers so central to democratic governments today. That system was designed as a
Mexican standoff, a confrontation which does not allow any party to achieve
victory. Evern brand of government monitors and regulates the other
branches.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> That was the
FIAT solution to not having a King or Queen.
</p>
<p>
In a RADICAL world, there would not be such a separation, although there might
be in particular cases.
</p>

<h3>The RADICAL Model</h3>
<p>
We are used to companies being governed by FIAT hierarchies, with an owner at
the top sending down commands, via a hierarchy, that tell people <em>what</em>
to do, <em>how</em> to do it, and <em>when</em> to do it. In this document, we
assume a RADICAL world that is, at the same time, alike and different from our
world today.
</p>
<p>
In the RADICAL model, a <em>company</em> is a group of people coming together to
create something bigger than each of them. Other labels abound, but we chose the
word “company” because it has an interesting genesis: it comes from the Latin
<em>con-</em> and <em>pan</em>. The prefix <em>con-</em> means “together, with”
and <em>pan</em> means “bread, food.” At its root, then, <em>company</em> means
“people who break bread together.” In the RADICAL model a company is a community
of people who come together to contribute broad value to society and make an
impact on the world.
</p>
<p>
Rather than having an owner and a hierarchy of bosses, a RADICAL company has
co-owners and co-managers to govern and operate it. These people align
themselves according to the impact they want to make, why they are doing so, and
then they embark on many experiments to get there..

<h3>Evolution, Interrupted</h3>
<p>
As I see it, the RADICAL model of co-ownership and co-management is the next
stage in collaboration. Everything humanity has accomplished has been based on
collaboration, but we have acted as if dominance by a few is the only way to
achieve it.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The dominance model of collaboration has become an obstacle to real progress and
it is now getting in the way of the next surge of human accomplishments. Now
it’s time to move on and build on the foundation of interdependence towards a
higher level of collaboration.
