<div style="display:none;">
 <p>There's nothing decentralized or autonomous about DAOs. That's not a criticism, it's simply an observation. They don't address the main societal issue today which is an overuse of force, and it's child, dominance.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; ">The DAO Myth</h1>
 <p>In spite of their name, there's nothing decentralized or autonomous about DAOs. I don't mean that as a criticism, but simply as an observation. Worse, the DAO technology is meant to make creating money-first organizations more efficient, with less friction. As such, it is a <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> technology.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, all the creativity that has gone into creating the DAO technology could also be used to create non-<span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> alternatives.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; ">DAOs Are Not Decentralized</h1>
 <p>They are as more or less centralized a as its governance model allows. Sure, people always have the choice of not joining the DAO, but thatâ€™s not a solution to our big problem. We need to move away from the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> ways of doing things and to a truly decentralized and autonomous alternative to our current because-I-say-so system, based on force and fear.<p>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; ">DAOs Are Not Autonomous</h1>
 <p>At least, not autonomous in the sense that &ldquo;it is run by code, not by people&rdquo;. In fact, they are governed and operated by committees of people. Even if those could be eliminated, &ldquo;code&rdquo; is created by one or more people.</p>
 <p>Autonomy is the domain of people. We need autonomous collaboration, and people collaborate via conversations. Today&rsquo;s DAOs are basically an <em>automoted investment</em> platform. Instead, we need a conversation platform supported by all the cool Web3 technology.</p>
