 <p>There's nothing decentralized or autonomous about DAOs. That's not a criticism, it's simply an observation. They don't address the main societal issue today which is an overuse of force, and it's child, dominance.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; ">The DAO Myth</h1>
 <p>In spite of their name, there's nothing decentralized or autonomous about DAOs. I don't mean that as a criticism, but simply as an observation. As a criticism I would point out that the DAO technology is a <em>automated investment</em> platform meant to make creating money-first organizations more efficient. As such, it is a technology</p> that would do nothing but expand <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> investment options.</p>
 <p>Financial investment has progressed from royalty, to wealthy patrons, to banks, to VCs: DAO is simply the next step in that progression. But the technology promises to do nothing towards taking ourselves and the world we live in. It is still grounded on the same principles of force and fear, "I have the capital, I am the boss." What it brings into the picture is a frictionless way for what VCs call <em>limited partners</em> (LP): more of them can enter at any capital amount. Great, more capitalists which should give way to more entrepreneurs. Not bad if you want to see the anthrosphere continue on its path to more fear, domination, force, and a bigger wealth gap with fewer and fewer at a higher, and higer top. The DAO technology as configured now will make that worse.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, all the creativity that has gone into creating the DAO technology could also be used to create alternatives to <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> regime.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; ">DAOs Are Not Decentralized</h1>
 <p>They are as more or less centralized, depending on its governance model allows. But there's no Sure, people always have the choice of not joining the DAO, but thatâ€™s not a solution to our big problem. <p>
 <p>We need to move away from the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> ways of doing things and to a truly decentralized and autonomous alternative to our current because-I-say-so system, based on force and fear.<p>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; ">DAOs Are Not Autonomous</h1>
 <p>At least, not autonomous in the sense that &ldquo;it is run by code, not by people&rdquo;. In fact, they are governed and operated by committees of people. Even if those could be eliminated, &ldquo;code&rdquo; is created by one or more people.</p>
 <p>Autonomy is the domain of people. We need autonomous collaboration, and people collaborate via conversations. Today&rsquo;s DAOs are basically an <em>automated investment</em> platform. Instead, we need a conversation platform supported by all the cool Web3 technology.</p>
