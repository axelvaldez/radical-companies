<div style="display:none;">
 <p>There's nothing decentralized or autonomous about DAOs. That's not a criticism, it's simply an observation. They don't address the main societal issue today which is an overuse of force, and it's child, dominance.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; ">The DAO Myth</h1>
 <p>In spite of their name, there's nothing decentralized or autonomous about DAOs. I don't mean that as a criticism, but simply as an observation. Worse, the DAO technology is meant to make creating money-first organizations more efficient, with less friction. As such, it is a <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> technology.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, all the creativity that has gone into creating the DAO technology could also be used to create non-<span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> alternatives.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; ">DAOs Are Not Decentralized</h1>
 <p>They are as decentralized, or not, as its governance model allows. Sure, people always have the choice of not joining the DAO, but thatâ€™s not a solution to our big problem. We need to move away from the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> ways of doing things and to a truly decentralized and autonomous alternative to our current system based on force.<p>

<h1 style="font-size:50px; ">DAOs Are Not Autonomous</h1>
 <p>At least, not autonomous in the sense that it is run by code not by people. In fact, they are governed and operated by committees of people. Even if those could be eliminated, &ldquo;code&rdquo; is created by one or more people.</p>
