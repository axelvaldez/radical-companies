 <p>"Certified" makes sense in the FIAT system, run by hierarchies and organized around domination through fear. But "certs" don't make sense in a RADICAL system, without hierachies, domination, or fear as "motivation."</p>
</div>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">How It Started</h1>
 <p>Today the issue of "certification" came up, as in "hey, it'd be nice to have a <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</a> cert." Although "certified" makes sense in the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</a> system, run by hierarchies and organized around domination through fear they incongrous with a system, like <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</a>, without hierachies, domination, or fear passing as "motivation." But given that we live in a <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> world, and will do so for a while, the drive for differentiation is not unreasonable. "We are <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span>!"</p>
 
<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Not Congruent</h1>
 <p>"Certs" are incongruent with the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> model<p> because they are issued by an authority, and a pretty arbitrary one at that. For example, Great Place to Work&trade; is an authority because it invested early in advertising and it was alsy very good at getting brand name clients like Forbes. Its survey is not at all scientific or methodological, but it is practical enough to be of value to businesses. The results are ranked and being number one is something that businesses brag about.
 <p>Unfortunately, the results of their surveys are completely opaque and the lack of transparency gets in the way. For example, nobody knows how they break ties when two companies have the same score. I can guess, but I don't really know. The ranking itself is useless for anything but bragging and a general sense that compainies at the top of the list are better, somehow.</p>
 <p>By contrast, WorldBlu does not rank their list.</p>
 <p>You can focus on the low-score categories and work to bring them up.</p>
