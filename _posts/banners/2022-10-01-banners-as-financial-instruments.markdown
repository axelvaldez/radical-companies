 <p><span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>s can be thought of as financial instruments, in particular  an investment agreement.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world we live in, an investment agreement is a legal document that specifies a financial return or ownership of a collateral. In the tech space, this collateral is most often a piece of the business that&rsquo;s taking the investment. This means that an investment is made based on the future <em>value of the business-as-collateral</em>. The business may be worth nothing now, but it may be worth of lot in the future (<em>e.g.</em>, the canonical example is Andy Becholsheim&rsquo;s very early investment in Google).</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>s can be the equivalent <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> arrangement having the wealth generated by an existing company fund a future company. The yielding value of an existing company is used as tge basis of ownership, instead of accumulated capital.</p>

 <p>Some, though not necessarily all, co-owners support it by committing some or all of their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to it. After 26 months the fund reaches $5M. New <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investors would shorten the time for the fund to be ready. This allows any co-owner to invest the future of the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s yield. Others won&rsquo;t and some can&rsquo;t. New co-owners may join the <span class="_paradigm">BANNERs</span> right away, others will wait a while, and still others will sit it out.</p>
 <p>Co-owners can use <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>s to make any other investment.</p>
 <p>In the end, ownership of the building is calculated as the percentage of contribution to the <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>.</p>
