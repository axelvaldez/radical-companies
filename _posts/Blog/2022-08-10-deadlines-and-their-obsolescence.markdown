 <p>The origin of the word deadline dates back to the US Civil War, when a line would be drawn around prisoners and if they crossed it in any way, they were shot. We are still prisoners getting &ldquo;shot&rdquo; for going over arbitrary deadlines.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The origin of the word deadline dates back to the US Civil War, when a line would be drawn around prisoners and if they crossed it in any way, they were shot. Nowadays we use deadlines to talk about self-imposed, and boss-imposed, temporal boundaries. Looking at things through a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> lens reveals that in many ways, the use of the word deadline has not actually changed that much since the Civil War.</p>
 <p>If we violate a self-imposed deadline, we feelt guilt because we were supposed to finish our work before the deadline. We learn this from our parents and, later, in school, when we are given tasks that are supposed to be complete by a certain time. If we do not complete them, we can be grounded, physically hit, having our grades marked down, or even having time taken away from us with detention. If your boss assigns a deadline, we may not feel as guilty. This type of deadline can be written off as arbitrary and unrealistic. Take, for example, the (in)famous deadlines that Elon Musk imposes on his companies and his predictions about self-driving Teslas by 2023 and human presence on Mars in 2033. So there is the arbitrary <em>deadline</em> and somebody is going to get  &ldquo;shot&rdquo; for going over it.</p>

 <h1>Urgency</h1>
 <p>Urgency has some value, but its value is often overblown. First mover advantages do not always confer victory in markets. Kodak was the first to make a digital camera, but now it is a moribund remnant of itself. Even a physical race is not guaranteed by being the first off the blocks. Looking at Usain Bolt, you can see him leap off the blocks a little slower than other athletes, but he makes consistent gains as he hits his stride and then outpaces everyone by a huge delta.</p>
 <p>Urgency provided by deadlines is mostly a justification for the inducement of fear. An email goes out to tell everyone at the company that <em>some people are not fulfilling their commitments</em> because they are not meetings top-down imposed deadlines. They are not pulling their weight. Changes might need to happen if people are not able to up their game and show they are top performers. I’m not fictionalizing this: it’s an actual email that came from a famous CEO.</p>
 <p>These things happen regularly. Sometimes the threat is bombastic, and sometimes it is delivered quite nicely. A boss might let you pick the deadlines so they can be more realistic and take your estimates into account. They might show concern that you don’t seem happy at the company during your annual review. Managers can be really helpful and kind and try to protect you from the arbitrariness of higher ups or the punishing realities of a performance formula.</p>

 <h1>Fear</h1>
 <p>But why use fear? Why is it so prevalent it seems fundamental to <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchies? We know from many psychological studies that punishment does not work very well. It has to be nearly instantaneous and the connection between action and punishment has to be super obvious, like someone putting their hands into a flame for the first time.</p>
 <p>We know that people who are afraid do not work well. Many of us have probably been in that situation at work. Rewards work far better. But rewards are rarely given for deadlines and, in any case, they are not <a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/08/09/rads-validated.html">tangible.</a></p>
 <p>Deadlines are used to create fear in prisoners and so it is with &ldquo;employees.&rdquo; As as far I can tell, the main reason for using fear as motivator is the lack of ownership.</p>

 <h1>No Engagement. No Ownership.</h1>
 <p>In a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business, ownership is concentrated at the top. It is material ownership (<em>e.g.</em>, stock) coupled with the sense that those at the top are the true shapers of the business, and employees are merely the implementors of the top&rsquo;s vision.</p>
 <p>In a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> context, people are peers in their company. They have access to power, the work is meaningful, and decision-making is decentralized. With all this, there's no need for urgency by bosses. There may be self-imposed deadlines, used mostly for coordination, but &ldquo;not making it&rdquo; is a learning opportunity, not fatal. They are good as a ballpark estimation of when a project might be done.</p>
 <p>You are able to decline one deadline and negotiate an alternative one. For example, when it is something new, it is nearly impossible to make an accurate estimate and that comes out in a coversation with other co-owners. Your peer may be asking for a thing that typically bosses ask for because that is what they know. But they are not your boss. You both are co-owners, as represented by <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. Intelligent solutions translate directly into rewards, not adhering to the conventions of the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> work environment.</p>

<h1>Fear Is All You Know</h1>
 <p>As you move down the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy, it becomes more and more justified to use deadlines that cause people to fear for their jobs, their reputation, their livelihoods. In a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business, as ownership and engagement dissappears, fear is all that's left to move <em>those at the bottom</em>.</p>
