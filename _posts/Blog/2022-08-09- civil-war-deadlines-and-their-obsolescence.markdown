<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The origin of the word deadline dates back to the American Civil War, when a line would be drawn around prisoners and if they crossed it in any way, they were  shot. Nowadays we use deadlines to talk about self-imposed and manager-imposed temporal boundaries. Looking at things through a RADICAL lens reveals that in many ways, the use of the word deadline has not actually changed that much since the Civil War.</p>
 <p>If we violate a self-imposed deadline, we feelt guilt because we were supposed to finish our work before the deadline. We learn that in school and from our parents when we are given tasks that are supposed to be complete by a certain time. And then when we do not complete them, we are punished. Either with being grounded, physically hit, having our grades marked down, or even having time taken away from us with detention. And then later at work, repeated deadline violations can be grounds for dismissal.</p>
 <p>So we are still prisoners getting “shot” in various ways for our going over arbitrary lines. If your boss assigns a deadline, you may not feel as guilty about violating it. That type of deadline can be written off as arbitrary and unrealistic. Think of the famous deadlines that Elon Musk imposes on his companies. Human presence on Mars by XXXX. Self-driving cars by XXXX. It has also become equally famous that Elon is bad at estimating how much time these ambitious goals can take.</p>
 <p>Urgency has some value, but its value is often overblown. First mover advantages do not always confer victory in markets. Kodak was the first to make a digital camera, but now it is a moribund remnant of itself. Even a physical race is not guaranteed by being the first off the blocks. Looking at Usain Bolt, you can see him leap off the blocks a little slower than other athletes, but he makes consistent gains as he hits his stride and then he outpaces everyone by a huge delta.</p>
 <p>Urgency provided by deadlines is mostly a justification for the inducement of fear. An email goes out as another top-down deadline goes by that tells everyone at the company that some people in the company are not fulfilling their commitments. They are not pulling their weight. And…changes might need to happen at the company if people are not able to up their game and show they are top performers. I’m not fictionalizing this. It’s an actual email I’m aware of that came from a famous CEO.</p>
 <p>These things happen on the regular. Sometimes the threat is bombastic, and sometimes it is given quite nicely. A boss might let you pick the deadlines so they can be more realistic and take your estimates into account. They might show concern that you don’t seem happy at the company during your annual review. Managers can be really helpful and kind and try to protect you from the arbitrariness of higher ups, or the punishing realities of a performance formula devised by HR.</p>
 <p>But why use fear? Why is it so prevalent it seems fundamental to FIAT hierarchies? We know from many psychological studies that punishment does not work very well. It has to be nearly instantaneous. And the connection between action and punishment  has to be super obvious. Like someone putting their hands into a flame for the first time. We know that people who are afraid do not work well. Many of us have probably been in that situation at work. Rewards work far better. But rewards are rarely given for deadlines. Maybe a party given at the end.</p>
 <p>Deadlines are used to create fear and urgency in prisoners. And so it has come down to employees. And the main reason for its use in that context is a lack of ownership. In a FIAT context, ownership is concentrated at the top. It is both material ownership in the form of stock, and the sense that those at the top are the true formers of the company and employees are merely the implements of the top down vision. As you traverse down the hierarchy it becomes more and more justified to use deadlines  and cause people to fear for their jobs. I cannot think of one instance where it is the CEO who is punished for not making a deadline. If CEOs regularly resigned for not making company deadlines, I would be more liable to believe all of the justifications that exist for deadlines in a FIAT environment.</p>
 <p>In a RADICAL context, people are equal peers in their company. They experience equal access to power, meaning, and belonging. Because of this, urgency does not come from the inducement of fear by managers. There may be self imposed deadlines, but they are hardly necessary. Deadlines are mainly used for coordination. And for giving people a ballpark estimation of when a project might be done. Deadlines can exist in their most benign context. And the ability to say no when you are asked for a deadline is far more actualized. For example, if it is something new that is being done it can be incredibly hard to estimate when a thing is done. If a peer in the company asks you for a deadline for that project, you can explain that it is folly to give a deadline. Giving one would be just to temporarily comfort your peer. And then it would dissatisfy them later if you missed it. They are asking for a thing that typically bosses ask for, bu they are not your boss. You have an equal share in the company and RADs come to you based on your interaction with the rest of the people in the company. In a RADICAL company you do not have to give them a deadline. In a RADICAL company, hard work and intelligent solutions translate directly into rewards, not adhering  to the conventions of the FIAT work environment.</p>
