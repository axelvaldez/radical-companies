 <p>Dictatorships are held together by historical roots, ideology-as-securalized-religion, and the very people they dominate. Looked at it through this lense, businesses are dictatorship and <em>The Power of Powerless</em> analysis applies to them as well.</p>

<h1>The Power of Dictatorships</h1>
 <p>In October 1978, Václav Havel, the Czech dramatist and then political dissident, published <em>The Power of the Powerless</em>. Twenty years later the Velvet Revolution brought a bloodless transition of power to the country and Havel as President.<sup id="bm01"><a href="#en01">1&nbsp;</a></sup></p>
 <p>In the essay, the most powerful point he makes is that what keeps together dictatorships is the acceptance of the very people that they oppress.<sup id="bm02"><a href="#en02">2&nbsp;</a></sup> <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> businesses are dictatorships interested only in extracting as much wealth as they can from the people they domninate.</p>
 <p>He also observed that sovie-style dictatorship are based on a huge power block, historical roots, ideology-as-securalized-religion, and State ownership of what Marx called &ldquo;the means of production,&rdquo; that is everything that can generate wealth. He also pointed out that Soviet-style dictatorships and Western democracies were different forms of the consumer-industrial society,</p>

<h1>Businesses as Dictatorships</h1>
 <p>As I read the essay, I got more and more excited as I realized how well the <span>RADICAL</span> model aligned to each of these points,</p>
 <table>
  <tr>
   <th><p>Huge<br>Power<br>Block</p></th>
   <td>
    <p>Within each nation, businesses &ldquo;hold sway over&rdquo; all levels of governments,  particularly about the way they get and spend their money. Around the world, multinationals &ldquo;hold sway over&rdquo; over many countries at once, &ldquo;a huge power block.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>In other words, businesses, no matter their size, are part of a <em>huge power block</em>.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Historical<br>Roots</th>
   <td>
     <p>Although there is not a <em>Left</em> and <em>Right</em> ideology when it comes to businesses, there is a cultural ideology that supports them. Among others, Roy S Jacques writes that &ldquo;<em>Beginning in the Western Europe of the fourteenth to sixteenth century one find a growth of a mode of consciousness&hellip; [that] has a &lsquo;mechanical&rsquo; orientation to it, emphasizing instrumentality, emotionlessness, accumulation, skepticism, individual consciousness, standardization, and objectification. It is also from this mode of consciousness that the particular form of production and exchange currently dominant worldwide has emerged.</em>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>He continues to say that between the 17th and 19th century, &ldquo;<em>Liberty no longer meant the freedom to perfect an enclosed city protected from the world. It was redirected as the freedom to conquer and order that outer world. Progress no longer meant movement toward a finite goal, but infinite expansion into a limitless universe</em>.&rdquo; Conquering and infinite expansion is the ideology that sustains businesses to this day.</p>
    <p>In other words, businesses have a <em>historiccal root</em>, one that is embedded in today&rsquo;s culture.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th><p>Ideology as<br>Securalized<br>Religion</p></th>
   <td>
    <p>The unquestioned acceptance of what ownership means and how it works is the secularized religion of businesses. &ldquo;Ownership&rdquo; is the mysterious, unmentionable name of this religion. The overwhelming majority of the stuff listed under &ldquo;business/economics,&rdquo; including books on self-management, are simply tweaks of this religion, but they are blind to the issue of &ldquo;ownership&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>In other words, the business ideaology, then, is the unquestioned acceptance of ownership as is.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th><p>State<br>Ownership</p></th>
   <td>
    <p>Admittedly, State ownership is a worst case, but ownership by a few bosses is pretty bad, too</p>
    <p>In other words, ownership as is the invisible culprit and we need to see it for what it is and all its implications.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th style="width:1.5in; "><p>Dictatorships<br>& Democracies</p></th>
   <td>
    <p>Admittedly, democracies are better for people than dictatorships. Still, they both are different shapes &ldquo;&hellip; of the consumer and industrial society.&rdquo;<sup id="bm08"><a href="#en08">8</a></sup></p>
    <p>In other words, if we can agree that extremely centralized ownership (<em>i.e.</em> Soviet-style dictatorships) doesn't work as well as more decentralized ownership, then we must move towards an <em>even more</em> decentralized ownership model (<em>i.e.</em> co-owned companies)</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="_spacer">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
<p>Businesses fit <em>every one</em> of theses observations. First, we have to stop &ldquo;going along&rdquo; with a system that&rsquo;s holding us back.</p>
<table>
 <tr>
  <th><p>Huge<br>Power<br>Block</p></th>
  <td>
   <p>Over time, and not due to a conspiracy or any such, businesses have come to make up a huge international block. We have to get over ourselves and wind down our support for them. We need to experiment with other models. The <span>RADICAL COMPANIES</span><sup id="bm09"><a href="#en09">9&nbsp;</a></sup> book offers a viable alternative.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th><p>Historical<br>Roots</p></th>
  <td><p>History is made little by little and that&rsquo;s how&rsquo;ve ended up in the mess we are in, burnig our own life boat. According to David Graeber, author of <em>Debt: the First 5,000 Years</em>,<a id="bm10" href="#en10"><sup>10</sup></a> the fuel for this has been quantified debt which gave birth to anonymous, fungible monney, which made possible to extract wealth of the other people&rsquo;s efforts.</p></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th><p>Ideology as<br>Securalized<br>Religion</p></th>
  <td>
   <p>In the Soviet-style dictatorships, their ideology was based, in theory, onMarx prescriptions, poor as they were. &ldquo;<em>Workers of the world, unite!</em>&rdquo; Western democracyies&rsquo; ideology ends up being something like, &ldquo;<em>Work hard and you too can become wealthy. Otherwise, good luck!</em>.&rdquo;<a id="bm11" href="#en11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

   <p>New wealth creates some public goods, but much of it ends up as private goods. In the case of dictatorships, the bosses at the top live very well. In democracies, some of this wealth ends up in the hands of a few business owners who also live very well while the rest is passed to the State where a lot of it ends up &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; or &ldquo;misspent&rdquo; or in the military (<em>i.e.</em>, graft for the <em>industrial-military complex</em> that then President Eisenhower warned us about). Even the public goods that come out of this benefit  businesses and the government&rsquo;s interests <em>primarily</em>. Roads and bridges make it possible for people to get to work to create wealth; the same roads and bridges make it easier to move the tanks where we need the muscle.</p>

  <th style="width:1.5in; "><p>Dictatorships<br>& Democracies</p></th>

   <p>People&rsquo;s effort and commerce fuels dictatorships <em>and</em> democracies alike. This is not to say that they are alike: by far, democracy is preferable that dictatorships (<em>i.e.</em>, I've live under both systems). But the fact still remains that they are both fueled by people&rsquo;s effort and commerce.</p>
   <p>Through the efforts and commerce, people create wealth. In dictatorships, a lot of it goes to the State; in democracies, much of it goes to businesses and then the State. Most people keep enough to make a living, through many not even than, and a bit more trickles down from the State in the form of infrastructure (<em>e.g.</em>, roads and bridges) and institutions (<em>e.g.</em>, public schools); for all intents and purposes, no public goods emanate from businesses (<em>i.e.</em>, not even from B Corps). In other words, this wealth creates some public goods, but the overwheling portian of it ends up in private hands.</p>
   <p>In the case of dictatorships, the top lives very well. In democracies, much of this wealth ends up in the hands of a few business owners who also live very well. In dictatorships and democracies, the rest is passed to the State where a lot of it ends up in the so-called <em>industrial-military complex</em>.<a id="bm12" href="#en12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
   <p>Even the public goods benefit businesses and the government&rsquo;s interests <em>primarily</em>. Roads and bridges make it possible for people to get to work to create wealth for others; the same roads and bridges make it easier to move military muscle.</p>
   <p>Most of us tend to interpret this as, &rdquo;<em>thank goodness, because if it weren't for the State/businesses/military would not have nice things like bridges, roads, and schools.</em>&rdquo; Sadly, this mindset stops from doing anything about it while it literally burns our life boat. It is going to be difficult to understand, to really get, but centralization is not good for us. Centralized ownership is hostile to innovation, and creativity, and even hostile to commerce. What innovation there is, (<em>e,g,</em>, pharmaceuticals) is accidental and it overwhelmingly ends up as private goods.</p>
   <p>If you believe, like I do, that decentralized ownership (<em>i.e.</em> democracy) is better than centralized State control (dictatorships)<a id="bm13" href="#en13"><sup>1</sup></a>, then it follows that you annd I should insist on <em>moving towards decentralization</em>. But, that requires a change in mindset that goes against everything we &ldquo;know,&rdquo; right?</p>
