 <p>Dictatorships are held together by historical roots, ideology-as-securalized-religion, and the very people that it dominates. The other foundation of dictatorship is money. David Graeber, author of Debt: The First 5,000 Years, makes a very convincing case that it is all based on debt and, particularly, debt quantified as money.<sup id="bn01"><a href="#en01">1&nbsp;</a></sup> Looked at it through this lense, businesses are dictatorship and The Power of Powerless analysis applies to them as well.</p>

<h1>The Power</h1>
 <p>In October 1978, Václav Havel, the Czech dramatist and then political dissident published <em>The Power of the Powerless</em>. Twenty years later the Velvet Revolution brought a bloodless transition of power to the country and Havel as President.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
 <p>In the essay, the most powerful point he makes is that what keeps together these communists dictatorships is the tacit participation of the very people that they oppress.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> FIAT businesses are dictatorships and they are interested only in extracting  as much wealth as they can.</p>
 <p>He also made the following observations,</p>

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
<h3><p style="text-align: right">
Huge<br>Power<br>Block</p>
</h3>


   </td>
   <td>
    The “system is not limited in a local, geographical sense.” Rather, he says, “it holds sway over a huge power block.”<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
<h3><p style="text-align: right">

    The system does not lack historical roots in that it took form on the back of “the proletarian social movements of the nineteenth century.”<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>

 <p>As I read the essay, I got more and more excited as it dawned on my how the RADICAL model aligned to each of these points,</p>

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
<h3><p style="text-align: right">
Huge<br>Power<br>Block</p>
</h3>


   </td>
   <td>
    Within each nation, businesses “hold sway over” all levels of governments, particularly about the way they get and spend their money. Around the world, multinationals “hold sway over” over many countries at once, “a huge power block.”
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
<h3><p style="text-align: right">
Historical Roots</p>
</h3>


   </td>
   <td>
    <p>Although there is not a <em>Left</em> and <em>Right</em> ideology when it comes to businesses, there is a cultural ideology that supports them. Among others, Roy S Jacques writes that “<em>Beginning in the Western Europe of the fourteenth to sixteenth century one find a growth of a mode of consciousness… [that] has a ‘mechanical’ orientation to it, emphasizing instrumentality, emotionlessness, accumulation, skepticism, individual consciousness, standardization, and objectification. It is also from this mode of consciousness that the particular form of production and exchange currently dominant worldwide has emerged.</em>”</p>
    <p>He continues to say that between the 17th and 19th century, “<em>Liberty no longer meant the freedom to perfect an enclosed city protected from the world. It was redirected as the freedom to conquer and order that outer world. Progress no longer meant movement toward a finite goal, but infinite expansion into a limitless universe</em>.” Conquering and infinite expansion is the ideology that sustains businesses to this day.</p>

<h3><p style="text-align: right">
Securalized Religion</p>
</h3>


   </td>
   <td>
    <p>The unquestioned acceptance of what ownership means and how it works is the secularized religion of businesses. “Ownership” is the mysterious, unmentionable name of this religion. The overwhelming majority of the stuff listed under “business/economics,” including and self-management, are simply tweaks of this religion, while “ownership” remains invisible.</p>
    <p>The other foundation of this religion is money. David Graeber, author of Debt: The First 5,000 Years, makes a very convincing case that it is all based on debt and, particularly, the quantification of debt into fungible money.<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>
