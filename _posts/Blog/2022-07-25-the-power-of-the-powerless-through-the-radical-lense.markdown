 <p>Dictatorships are held together by historical roots, ideology-as-securalized-religion, and the very people they dominate. Looked at it through this lense, businesses are dictatorship and <em>The Power of Powerless</em> analysis applies to them as well.</p>

<h1>The Power of Dictatorships</h1>
 <p>In October 1978, Václav Havel, the Czech dramatist and then political dissident, published <em>The Power of the Powerless</em>. Twenty years later the Velvet Revolution brought a bloodless transition of power to the country and Havel as President.<sup id="bm01"><a href="#en01">1&nbsp;</a></sup></p>
 <p>In the essay, the most powerful point he makes is that what keeps together dictatorships is the acceptance of the very people that they oppress.<sup id="bm02"><a href="#en02">2&nbsp;</a></sup> <span>FIAT</span> businesses are dictatorships interested only in extracting as much wealth as they can from the people they domninate.</p>
 <p>He also observed that sovie-style dictatorship are based on a huge power block, historical roots, ideology-as-securalized-religion, and State ownership of what Marx called &ldquo;the means of production,&rdquo; that is everything that can generate wealth. He also pointed out that Soviet-style dictatorships and Western democracies were different forms of the consumer-industrial society,</p>

<h1>Businesses as Dictatorships</h1>
<p>As I read the essay, I got more and more excited as I realized how well the <span>RADICAL</span> model aligned to each of these points,</p>
<table>
 <tr>
  <th><p>Huge<br>Power<br>Block</p></th>
  <td>
   <p>Within each nation, businesses &ldquo;hold sway over&rdquo; all levels of governments, particularly about the way they get and spend their money. Around the world, multinationals &ldquo;hold sway over&rdquo; over many countries at once, &ldquo;a huge power block.&rdquo;</p>
   <p>In other words, businesses, no matter their size, are part of a <em>huge power block</em>.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th>Historical<br>Roots</th>
  <td>
    <p>Although there is not a <em>Left</em> and <em>Right</em> ideology when it comes to businesses, there is a cultural ideology that supports them. Among others, Roy S Jacques writes that &ldquo;<em>Beginning in the Western Europe of the fourteenth to sixteenth century one find a growth of a mode of consciousness&hellip; [that] has a &lsquo;mechanical&rsquo; orientation to it, emphasizing instrumentality, emotionlessness, accumulation, skepticism, individual consciousness, standardization, and objectification. It is also from this mode of consciousness that the particular form of production and exchange currently dominant worldwide has emerged.</em>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>He continues to say that between the 17th and 19th century, &ldquo;<em>Liberty no longer meant the freedom to perfect an enclosed city protected from the world. It was redirected as the freedom to conquer and order that outer world. Progress no longer meant movement toward a finite goal, but infinite expansion into a limitless universe</em>.&rdquo; Conquering and infinite expansion is the ideology that sustains businesses to this day.</p>
   <p>In other words, businesses have a <em>historiccal root</em>, one that is embedded in today&rsquo;s culture.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th><p>Ideology as<br>Securalized<br>Religion</p></th>
  <td>
   <p>The unquestioned acceptance of what ownership means and how it works is the secularized religion of businesses. &ldquo;Ownership&rdquo; is the mysterious, unmentionable name of this religion. The overwhelming majority of the stuff listed under &ldquo;business/economics,&rdquo; including books on self-management, are simply tweaks of this religion, but they are blind to the issue of &ldquo;ownership&rdquo;.</p>
   <p>In other words, the business ideaology, then, is the unquestioned acceptance of ownership as is.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th><p>State<br>Ownership</p></th>
  <td>
   <p>Admittedly, State ownership is a worst case, but ownership by a few bosses is pretty bad, too</p>
   <p>In other words, ownership as is the invisible culprit and we need to see it for what it is and all its implications.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th style="width:1.5in; "><p>Dictatorships<br>& Democracies</p></th>
  <td>
   <p>Admittedly, democracies are better for people than dictatorships. Still, they both are different shapes &ldquo;&hellip; of the consumer and industrial society.&rdquo;<sup id="bm09"><a href="#en09">9</a></sup></p>
   <p>In other words, if we can agree that extremely centralized ownership (<em>i.e.</em> Soviet-style dictatorships) doesn't work as well as more decentralized ownership, then we must move towards an <em>even more</em> decentralized ownership model (<em>i.e.</em> co-owned companies)</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class="_spacer">&nbsp;</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>Businesses fit <em>every one</em> of theses observations. First, we have to stop &ldquo;going along&rdquo; with a system that&rsquo;s holding us back.</p>
<table>
 <tr>
  <th><p>Huge<br>Power<br>Block</p></th>
  <td>
   <p>Over time, and not due to a conspiracy or any such, businesses have come to make up a huge international block. We have to get over ourselves and wind down our support for them.We need to experiment with other models. The <span>RADICAL COMPANIES</span><sup id="bm10"><a href="#en10">10</a></sup> book offers a viable alternative.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th><p>Historical<br>Roots</p></th>
  <td>
    <p>Little by little, that&rsquo;s how history is made and that&rsquo;s how&rsquo;ve ended up in the mess we are in, burnig our own life boat.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th><p>Ideology as<br>Securalized<br>Religion</p></th>
  <td>
   <p></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th><p>State<br>Ownership</p></th>
  <td>
   <p></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th style="width:1.5in; "><p>Dictatorships<br>& Democracies</p></th>
  <td>
   <p>Human commerce fuels dictatorships and democracies. In dictatorship case the wealth that it creates goes to the State and then trickels down to the people in the form of infrastructure (<em>e.g.</em>, roads and bridges) and institutions (<em>e.g.</em>, public schools, the police).</p>
   <p>Not surprinsingly, this infrastructure and these institutions also benefit businesses and the military, big time. Roads and bridges make it easier for people to go to work at businesses and the same roads and bridges make it easier to move the tanks when we need the muscle.</p>

   Labels like <em>Left</em> or <em>Right</em> don&rsquo;t matter, dictatorships are the same, and they know it. For example, Cuba&rsquo;s Castro and Argentina&rsquo;s Perón had a close relationship and supported each other, even though the former claimed to be &ldquo;Left&rdquo; and the latter &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;
