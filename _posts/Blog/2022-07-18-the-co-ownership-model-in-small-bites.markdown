 <p>Co-ownership is too big pill to swallow in one gulp, so we need to make smaller pills.</p>

 <p>Co-ownership is a big pill to swallow all in one gulp. It scares people and they react by accussing it of being utopian (<em>i.e.</em>, &ldquo;It won't work in the real world&rdquo;) or a political scheme (<em>i.e.</em>, &ldquo;The communists tried it, it didn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;).</p>
 <p>Here a couple of smaller bites that people may be less fearful to experiment with. It is less threatening and signals &ldquo;progressive.&rdquo;</p>

  alt="The heading reads Co-Ownership. Below it there are three circles with bite marks over most of it.">
 <p>Rather than attempting to change the ownership structure of the whole business, we are talking about a repayment fund and a bonus fund.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace;  margin-top:50px;">Repayment Fund</h1>
 <p>We have gotten used to taking cash infusions from Angels and VCs. Angel investors get a note that promises them a future take. Then VCs show up and makes a big investment. The Angels get their money back <em>and</em> their promised take, and the VC gets a piece of the business. More often than not, a &ldquo;lead VC&rdquo; brings other VCs along and together they end up with <em>majority control</em> of the business.</p>
 <p>In theory, investors don&rsquo;t have a say in day-to-day operations, but in practice if there&rsquo;s something they don&rsquo;t like, they can fire the CEO and get a new one to change what they don&rsquo;t like. The end result is that money making ends up being the only priority while everything else falls by the proverbial wayside. The product, the technology, and, worst of all, the people become replaceable pieces of the money-making machine.</p>
 <p>That&rsquo;s the way the <span class="_paradigms">FIAT</span> world works and something we are so used to that we don&rsquo;t even notice. Unfortunately, if it continues to operate this way, we will go deeper into a dystopia that we may, or may not, be able to come out of.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigms">RADICAL</span> model is an alternative to a non-dystopian future. The <span class="_paradigms">RADICAL COMPANIES</span> book proposes a model where companies are co-managed, but they are also <em>co-owned</em> by everybody who contributes to it, not just a few bosses. There are plenty of benefits of not having all decision-making centralized in the hands of one or a few people.  Unfortunately, it scares the bejesus out of bosses <em>and</em> employees: the boss&rsquo; self-image and future wealth are at risk, and so is the employees&rsquo; livelihood. Start ups and small companies in general are less scared of this model, but bigger or more established businesses can&rsquo;t even fathom it.</p>
 <p>Instead, we can try the co-ownership model in smaller bites. Like, an annual bonus fund, or an investment repayment fund. Decentralizing these disbritions could give everybody involved a taste of how it works. They may even see how it could be applied elsewhere, even outside the company.</p>
 <p>For example, an investor gives the company $200K to be repaid with 10% interest in two years. Normally, the interest belongs to the investor. But let&rsquo;s say that instead the company matches the 10% interest with an additional 10% to end up with a $40K fund. The money in the fund would then be distributed to everybody involved in repaying the investment, including all the employees, using <span class="_paradigms">RAD</span>s.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace;  margin-top:50px;">The Annual Bonus</h1>
 <p>The so-called <em>bonus</em><a id="bn01" href="#en01"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></a> is similar in that it is a fund that is going to be distributed, usually every quarter or at the end of the year.</p>
 <p>The usual distribution is based on a whim or a formula. Most often it is done by the boss&rsquo; whim, &ldquo;this guy is very good and we have to make sure to keep him.&rdquo; Other businesses, trying to be more progressive, establish a formula. This is usually based on years of experience, schooling level, tenure, and other so-called objective measures. I say so-called because in the end they are not at all objective even if they are <em>measurable, given our biases</em>. For example, &ldquo;schooling level&rdquo; has a lot to do with the opportunity somebody had to attend a university; &ldquo;years of experience&rdquo; really means tenure at other, similar companies in similar delimited jobs, but it doesn&rsquo;t account for other flavors of experience in other areas. If anything, what I&rsquo;ve called &ldquo;the boss&rsquo; whim&rdquo; is closer to recognizing <em>the value of contributions</em> and that is what <span class="_paradigms">RAD</span>s do.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace;  margin-top:50px;">RAD Distributions</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigms">RAD Distributions</span><a id="bn02" href="#en02"><sup>2&nbsp;</sup></a> are all about recognizing contributions and <em>assigning them a value</em>. That is what the boss is doing, although nobody else knows if the recognition had to do with a contribution to the bottom line, to the operations, or to his ego. <span class="_paradigms">RAD Distributions</span><a href="#en02"><sup>2&nbsp;</sup></a> do a similar thing, but lets everybody participate, not just the bosses. They also assign a tangible value to each contribution that can later be translated to a percentage of, say, revenue, or a bonus fund, or an investment repayment fund. <span class="_paradigms">RAD Distributions</span> are a tool for decentralizing the recognition of contributions. No central boss or formula needed for these distributions.</p>
