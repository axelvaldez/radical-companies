 <p>Co-ownership is too big pill to swallow in one gulp, so we need to make smaller pills.</p>
</div>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace;  margin-top:50px; ">The Big Pill</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership is a big pill to swallow all in one gulp. It scares people and they react by accussing it of being utopian or a communist scheme  (<em>i.e.</em>, &ldquo;I see, but it won't work in the real world&rdquo;).</p>
 <img style="margin-left:10px; float:right; font-family:Courier New, monospace; font-size:smaller; width:40%; " src="/assets/img/co-ownership-in-small-bites.svg" alt="The heading reads Co-Ownership. Below it there are two circles with bit marks in their upper-left. The circle on the left is big and it's label 'All of It;' the  circle on the right is smaller ans it is labelled 'Smaller Bites.'">
 <p>Here is a much smaller bite that people may be more willing to experiment with. It is less threatening and signals &ldquo;progressive*&rdquo;.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; margin-top:50px; ">The Smaller Bite</h1>
 <p>Rather than attempting to change the ownership structure of the whole business, this is much smaller pill to take because it is about the distribution method of a specific fund. In this case, we are talking about an investment fund, but it can also apply to the tradional annual "bonus" or any type of financial distribution.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace;  margin-top:50px;">Repayment Fund</h1>
 <p>We are used to taking a cash infusion from Angels or VCs. Angel investors get a note that promises them a future take. Then VCs show up, make a big investment, the Angels get their money back <em>and</em> their promised take, and the VC gets a piece of the business. More often than not, a &ldquo;lead VC&rdquo; brings other VCs along and together they end up with <em>majority control</em> of the business.</p>
 <p>In theory, investors don&rsquo;t have a say in day-to-day operations, but in practice if there&rsquo;s something they don&rsquo;t like, they can fire the CEO and get a new one to change what they don&rsquo;t like. The end results is that money making ends up being the only priority and everyhthing else falls by the proverbial wayside. The product, the technology, and, worst of all, the people become fungible, repleacable pieces subservient to the money-making puzzle.</p>
 <p>That&rsquo;s the way the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> world works and something we are so used to that we don&rsquo;t even notice. Unfornately, if it continues to operate this way, we will go deeper into a dystopia that we may, or may not, be able to come out of.</p>
 <p>The <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> model is an alternative to a non-dystopian future. The <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL COMPANIES</span> book proposes a model where companies are co-managed, but they are also <em>co-owned</em> by everybody who contributes to it, not just a few bosses. There are plenty of benefits of not having all decision-making centralized in the hands of one or a few people.  Unfortunately, it scares the beejesus out of bosses <em>and</em> employees: the boss&rsquo; self-image and future wealth are at risk, and so is the employees&rsquo; livelihood. Start ups and small companies in general are less scared of this model, but bigger or more established businesses can&rsquo;t even fanthom it.</p>
 <p>Instead, we can try the co-ownership model in smaller bites. Like, an annual bonus fund, or an investment repayment fund. Decentralizing these disbritions could give everybody involved a taste of how it works. They may even see how it could be applied elsewhere, even outside the company.</p>
 <p>For example, an investor gives the company $200K to be repaid with 10% interest in two years. Normally, the interest belongs to the investor. But let&rsquo;s say that instead the company matches the 10% interest with an additional 10% to end up with a $40K fund. The money in the fund would then be distributed to everybody involved in repaying the investment, including all the employees, using <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RAD</span>s.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace;  margin-top:50px;">The Annual Bonus</h1>
 <p>The so-called <em>bonus</em><a id="bn01" href="#en01"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></a> is similar in that it is a fund that is going to be distributed, usually every quarter or at the end of the year.</p>
 <p>The usual distribution is based on a whim or a formula. Most often it is done by the boss&rsquo; whim, &ldquo;this guy is very good and we have to make sure to keep him.&rdquo; Other businesses, trying to be more progressive, establish a formula. This is usually based on years of experience, schooling level, tenure, and other so-called objective measures. I say so-called because in the end they are not at all objective even if they are <em>measurable, given our biases</em>. For example, &ldquo;schooling level&rdquo; has a lot to do with the opportunity somebody had to attend a university; &ldquo;years of experience&rdquo; really means tenure at other, similar companies in similar delimited jobs, but it doesn&rsquo;t account for other flavors of experience in other areas. If anything, what I&rsquo;ve called &ldquo;the boss&rsquo; whim&rdquo; is closer to recognizing <em>the value of contributions</em> and that is what <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RAD</span>s do.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace;  margin-top:50px;">RAD Distributions</h1>
 <p><span style="font-size:smaller; ">RAD Distributions</span><a id="bn02" href="#en02"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></a> are all about recognizing contributions and <em>assigning them a value</em>. That is what the boss is doing, although nobody else knows if the recognition had to do with a contribution to the bottom line, to the operations, or to his ego. <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RAD Distributions</span><a href="#en02"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></a> do a similar thing, but let&rsquo;s everybody participate, not just the bosses. They also assign a tangible value to each contribution that can later be translated to a percentage of, say, revenue, or a bonus fund, or an investment repayment fund. <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RAD Distributions</span> are a tool for decentralizing the recognition of contributions. No central boss or formula needed for these distributions.</p>
