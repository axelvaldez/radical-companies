 <p>We need RECs in additons to RADs.</p>

<h1>RADICAL Units of Measure</h1>
 <p>In our book, <em><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL COMPANIES</span></em><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> we came up with <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s as a unit of measure. It turns out that what we really need is a unit of <em>recognition</em> and a unit of <em>distribution</em>. <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> is the distribution unit, and it accounts for the unaccountable. It measure the value of contributions as recognized by your peers. It is not at all conneced to hours or title or any such thing. The unit of recognition could remain nameless and hide behind the <span class="_paradigm">RADs</span> App<a href="bm02"><sup id="#en02">2&nbsp;</sup></a> algorithm, but to be transparent, we need a name for it and we are calling it REC for now.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> as a Unit of Distribution</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are a unit of distribution. The <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s  your peer co-owners give you accumulate as percentage of the total <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s you have given to date. Then anything that has to be distributed, say Earned Dividends<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">3&nbsp;</sup></a>, are multiplied by that percentage to calculate the amount you get.</p>
 <p>As we tried to use <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s in the <em>RADs! app</em>, it got too clumsy and cumbersome. You ended up adding and subtracting, the kind of cognitive stuff that we didn&rsquo;t want. We wanted to capture the <em>feeling</em> that the contribution brought up in a co-owner and it became obvious that we needed something other than <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s</p>
 
<h1>A Unit of Recognition</h1>
 <p>To make the process, and the app, easier to use, we needed a unit of recognition, but they work completely in the background.</p>
 <p>The <em>RADs! app</em> now lets a co-owner press a recognition button as many times as she feels like it (<em>i.e.</em>, really, there's no limit). This captures the <em>intensity of the feeling</em> that the contribution brought up in the giving co-owner. Let&rsquo;s call her Deb.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom:0; ">At the end of the cycle, the recognitions that Deb gave other co-owners convert to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s,
  <ul>
   <li>The number of recognitions Deb gave each co-owner is divided by the total she gave during the period.</li>
   <li>Each resulting percentage is then multiplied by the total number of days in the cycle.</li>
   <li>This results in the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s other co-owners get from Deb.</li>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <div style="text-align:center; ">

   alt="This is a formula. Its input is 'feelings about contributions.' In the middle, the number of recognitions per co-owner divided by the total number of recognitions given during the cycle. This is then multiplied by the number of days in the cycle. The result is the number of RADs each co-owner gets.">
