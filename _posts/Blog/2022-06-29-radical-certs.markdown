 <p>"Certificates" fit in a FIAT world we live in, run by hierarchies and organized around domination through fear. But "certs" don't make sense within a RADICAL system, without hierachies or domination."</p>
</div>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">How It Started</h1>
 <p>The issue of &ldquo;certification&rdquo;s came up as: &ldquo;<em>it'd be nice to have a <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> cert.</em>&rdquo; The thing is that &ldquo;certified&rdquo; makes sense in the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> system, run by hierarchies and organized around domination through fear:  <em>a mighty authority certifies that you are qualified</em>. On the other hand, &ldquo;certs&rdquo; are incongrous with a <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> model, without hierachies, domination, or fear passing as &ldquo;motivation.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Given that we live in a <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> world, and will do so for a while, the urge for differentiation is not unreasonable: &ldquo;Hey, we are <em>certified</em> as  <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span>!&rdquo; However, rather than an external authority, the <em>people</em> who embody a company <em>are</em> the ones to positivily declare that, &ldquo;<em>We are on a <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> path, and here&rsquo;s the data that tells where we are at along the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> foundation.</em>&rdquo;
 
<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Not Congruent</h1>
 <p>&ldquo;Certs&rdquo; are incongruent with the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> model because they are issued by an external authority. Their job is to investigate, quantify, and corroborate any and all claims that a few people (<em>i.e.</em>, the bosses) may make.</p>
 <p>For example, the <em>Great Place to Work&trade; Institure</em> (GPTW) is a &ldquo;culture authority&rdquo; because early on it was very good at getting brand name clients like Forbes. Their product is a survey that they send out to everybody in the client company and then they return to the company their score broken down by categories. The survey and its categories are not very scientif or methodological, but it is practical enough. 
 Companies in the same category (according to whom?) are ranked. the ranking itself is pretty useless for anything but bragging rights. &ldquo;Higher&rdquo; is not &ldquo;better,&rdquo;. Other companies have tried to compete with them with equally arbitrary surveys, but have not been very successful.</p>
 <p>For another, <em>B Labs</em> has become a &ldquo;social and environmental impact authority&rdquo; with its &ldquo;B Corp certificate.&rdquo; According to Wikipedia, &ldquo;<em>companies must receive a minimum score of 80 from an assessment of social and environmental performance, integrate B Corp commitments to stakeholders into company governing documents, and pay an annual fee based on annual sales. Companies must re-certify every three years to retain B Corporation status.</em>&rdquo; For many <em>B Labs</em> customers the &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; only amounts to virtue signaling and bragging rights.</p>
 
<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Nonetheless</h1>
 <p>In our <span style="font-size:smaller; ">FIAT</span> world, it makes sense to have external <em>authorities</em> investigate that management is not lying or are pressuring their employees to &lsquo;be positive.&rdquo; The resulting <em>certificate</em> and their raking make the service easier to sell to the bosses.</p>
 <p>By contrast, in the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> model, a company&rsquo;s co-owners, backed by fully transparent data, are the ultimate authority in declaring what path they're on based on what they live day and day out.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">To Protect Employees</h1>
 <p>The result of these surveys are redacted, &ldquo;<em>for the privacy and safety of employees</em>.&rdquo; But that excuse does not apply in the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> model since there are no employees who can be fired for voicing their feelings or pointing out what needs fixing. <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> co-owners don't need &ldquo;protection&rdquo; from hearing what others have to say. In fact, because the data is fully transparent, the same is true for the community outside the company: anybody can look at the detail, ask questions, comment on conclusions, and, ultimately, learn.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">What Is the Alternative?</h1>
 <p>Surveys are fine for collecting data relatively quickly, but they need to have a foundation. WorldBlu&rsquo;s survey is based on 10 Principles. For a <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> company this would be,</p>

<p>Questions based on these priciples, commitments, amd practices would give companies, and anybody else who cares to look, a view of how the company is doing, what needs to change/improve, etc. The details will come in coversations, as always.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">If It Works, Do It</h1>
<p>Instead of annual surveys, it may be more valuable to have, for example,pipelined mini-surveys. The point is to show a company&rsquo;s progression from one end of the spectrum (<em>e.g.</em>, more centralized) to the other (<em>e.g.</em> less centralized).</p>
<p>A company can say that, &ldquo;We are on the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</span> path&hellip; and here's my data, see for yourself.&rdquo; Only the <em>people</em> who embody the company, not an arbitrary third party, can attest.
