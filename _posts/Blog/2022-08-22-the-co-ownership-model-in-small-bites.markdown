 <p>Co-ownership is too big pill to swallow in one gulp, so we need to make smaller pills.</p>

<h1>Smaller Bites</h1>

 <p>Co-ownership is a big pill to swallow all in one gulp. It scares people and they react by accussing it of being utopian (<em>i.e.</em>, &ldquo;It won't work in the real world&rdquo;) or a political scheme (<em>i.e.</em>, &ldquo;The communists tried it, it didn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;).</p>

  alt="The heading reads Co-Ownership. Below it there are three circles with bite marks over most of it.">
 <p>This post is about a few smaller bites that, we hope, people may find be less threatening and signal &ldquo;progressiveness.&rdquo; Rather than attempting to change the ownership structure of the whole business, we are talking about starting with a co-owned repayment fund and a co-owned bonus fund.</p>
 <br style="clear:both; ">
 <p>We have gotten used to taking cash infusions from Angels and VCs. Angel investors get a note that promises them a future take. Then VCs show up and makes a big investment. The Angels get their money back <em>and</em> their promised take, and the VC gets a piece of the business. More often than not, a lead VC brings other VCs along and together they end up with <em>majority control</em> of the business.</p>
 <p>In theory, investors don&rsquo;t have a say in day-to-day operations, but in practice if there&rsquo;s something they don&rsquo;t like, they can fire the CEO and get a new one to change what they don&rsquo;t like. The end result is that money making ends up being the only priority while everything else falls by the proverbial wayside. The product, the technology, and, worst of all, the people become replaceable pieces of the money-making machine.</p>
 <p>That&rsquo;s the way the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world works and something we are so used to that we don&rsquo;t even notice. Unfortunately, if it continues to operate this way, we will go deeper into a dystopia that we may, or may not, be able to come out of.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model is an alternative to a dystopian future. In the <em>RADICAL COMPANIES</em> book we propose a model where companies are co-owned and co-managed by everybody who contributes to it, not just a few bosses. There are plenty of benefits of not having all decision-making centralized in the hands of one or a few people.  Unfortunately, it scares the bejesus out of bosses <em>and</em> employees. Bosses fear that their role and self-image are at risk; employees fear for their livelihood. Start ups and small companies in general are less scared of this model, but bigger or more established businesses can&rsquo;t even fathom it.</p>
 <p>Instead, we can try the co-ownership model in smaller bites. Like, an investment repayment fund or an annual bonus fund. Decentralizing these distributions gives everybody involved a taste of how they works and they may even see how it could be applied elsewhere, inside or outside the business.</p>

<h1>Repayment Fund</h1>
 <p>For example, an investor gives the company $200K to be repaid with 10% interest in two years. Normally, the interest belongs to the investor. But let&rsquo;s say that instead the company matches the 10% interest with an additional 10% to end up with a $40K fund. The money in the fund would then be distributed to everybody, including the investor, involved in repaying the investment using <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>

<h1>The Annual Bonus</h1>
 <p>The so-called <em>bonus</em><a id="bn01" href="#en01"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></a> is similar. The usual distribution is based on a whim or a formula.</p>
 <p>Often, it is done by the boss. &ldquo;This guy is very good and we have to make sure to keep him.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Other businesses, trying to be more progressive, establish a formula. This is usually based on years of experience, schooling level, tenure, and other so-called objective measures. I say so-called because in the end they are not always <em>objective</em> even if they are <em>measurable</em>. For example, a certain level schooling may not be necessary, but become part of the requirement because whoever wrote the requirement had a Masters degree from a brand university. &ldquo;Years of experience&rdquo; really means tenure at other, similar companies in similar jobs, but it doesn&rsquo;t account for other flavors of experience in other areas.</p>
 <p>If anything, what I&rsquo;ve called &ldquo;the boss&rsquo; whim&rdquo; is closer to recognizing <em>the value of contributions</em> and that is what <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s do.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s<a id="bn02" href="#en02"><sup>2&nbsp;</sup></a> are all about recognizing contributions <em>and assigning them a value</em>. What the boss is doing when he assigns bonuses does it but in the privacy of his mind&mdash;nobody else knows if he is recognizing a financial contribution to the business&rsquo; bottom line or to his ego.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are a tool for decentralizing the recognition of contributions. It is similar to what they boss does in his head, but, instead, lets everybody do it. These distributions is fully transparent, too, including the reason why each contribution is being recognized. Finally, <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s make contributions <em>tangible</em>. Instead of vague attaboy, <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s can be translated to a percentage of, say, profits (<em>i.e.</em>, earned dividends).</p>

<h1>Building Communities</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s could also be as a way to implement ways of easing into co-ownership <em>by building communities</em>.</p>
 <h2>Adjacent Software Projects</h2>
  <p>A young friend of mine is working a very different approach to programming that would make it easier to build sophisticated programs. It is not the typical approach of tying together prebuild modules. He already has seeded other projects that have been embraced by developers, so this is bound to make a similar impact. But this kind of work is pretty lonely. There&rsquo;s never a ready-made community, but there is other work going on that is adjacent to it. That is where <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s can make a difference: they can help create a community</em>.</p>
  <p>My friend could seed a community with people who understands and believe in what he is doing, and also with people who are working on technology that may turn out to be relevant to his work (<em>i.e.</em>, not immediately adjacent, but close enough). He could invite these people to his <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community and they could help each other with feedback, critique, code, financial support, and whatever else comes up. This software community could end up trasforming prototypes into products.</p>
  <p>In the software space, there are,
   <ul>
    <li>People who like ideas and writing about it,</li>
    <li>Others like transforming ideas into prototypes, and</li>
    <li>Still others like to transform prototypes into products</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Transforming protypes into products is where it gets messy. At this point you have to form a copmpany to raise capital, then you get a Board of investors-as-owners, and your prototype-into-product intentions fall by the way side and you end up with a prototype-to-paying customers business. A lot of prople find that&hellip; not &ldquo;right.&rdquo; Nobody minds the money that comes along with all that, but they may not be comfortable with the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> mindset and behavior that it requires.</p>
  <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s bypass the whole business/money/hierarchy stuff. My friend&rsquo;s community could deliver products if it grows to include people with different intests, in particular people who like doing the prototype-to-product part of it. As revenue from those products starts to come in, it can be distributed to the people who contributed to making it <span style="font-weight:bold; ">all</a> happen based on how many <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s each has been given by their community.</p>
  <p>A good example is the Bichrler-Nitzan research team. Recently Adrian Perez, a RADICAL COMPANIES co-author, pointed me to <em>Growing through Sabotage</em>,<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">3&nbsp;</sup></a> a fantastic, mind-blowing work (<em>i.e.</em> long but worth it). In it, they cite Blair Fix&rsquo;s work several times. And, as it so happens, Blair Fix has his own Patreon page.<a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">4&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
  <p>Bichler and Nitzan, for example, could form a community by inviting Fix and any other adjacent researcher into it. This community could then have a Patreon page. The Patreon funds would then be distributed to community members based the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s each researcher receives for their community peers. I, for one, would prefer to sign up to support that community rather than single researchers. The benefit to me-as-sponsor is that 1) I could post questions to the whole community and 2) have access to all their work. The researchers themselves could help each other by reviewing each other&rsquo;s papers, providing their prespectives, co-authoring,<a href="#en05"><sup id="bm05">5&nbsp;</sup></a> etc. This makes a community of collaborating researchers more trustworthy than a more traditional group of competing researchers.</p>
  <p>Not only is the community more trusworthy, but individual researchers who embody it would be too. The number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s each researcher has been given is an indicator of the level of trust with their peers. The more <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s a researcher has, the more he can be trusted. For example, there are researches who don&rsquo;t publish a lot of papers, but contribute in other ways to the community. In the traditional <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> organizations of competing researchers they don't get much recognition and are relegated to second banana roles. In a community of collaborating researchers they would end up with a lot of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>

  <li id="en01">
   <p>A &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; is not a gift. What is normally called &ldquo;bonuses&rdquo; really are <em>earned dividends</em>, &ldquo;&hellip; paid to shareholders from surplus profits.&rdquo;. This is a form of wealth extraction from the value everybody, including you, helped create.
