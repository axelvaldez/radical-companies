 <p>Co-ownership is too big pill to swallow in one gulp, so we need to make smaller pills.</p>

<h1>Smaller Bites</h1>

 <p>Co-ownership is a big pill to swallow all in one gulp. It scares people and they react by accussing it of being utopian (<em>i.e.</em>, &ldquo;It won't work in the real world&rdquo;) or a political scheme (<em>i.e.</em>, &ldquo;The communists tried it, it didn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;).</p>

  alt="The heading reads Co-Ownership. Below it there are three circles with bite marks over most of it.">
 <p>This post is about a few smaller bites that, we hope, people may find be less threatening and signal &ldquo;progressiveness.&rdquo; Rather than attempting to change the ownership structure of the whole business, we are talking about starting with a co-owned repayment fund and a co-owned bonus fund.</p>
 <br style="clear:both; ">
 <p>We have gotten used to taking cash infusions from Angels and VCs. Angel investors get a note that promises them a future take. Then VCs show up and makes a big investment. The Angels get their money back <em>and</em> their promised take, and the VC gets a piece of the business. More often than not, a lead VC brings other VCs along and together they end up with <em>majority control</em> of the business.</p>
 <p>In theory, investors don&rsquo;t have a say in day-to-day operations, but in practice if there&rsquo;s something they don&rsquo;t like, they can fire the CEO and get a new one to change what they don&rsquo;t like. The end result is that money making ends up being the only priority while everything else falls by the proverbial wayside. The product, the technology, and, worst of all, the people become replaceable pieces of the money-making machine.</p>
 <p>That&rsquo;s the way the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world works and something we are so used to that we don&rsquo;t even notice. Unfortunately, if it continues to operate this way, we will go deeper into a dystopia that we may, or may not, be able to come out of.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model is an alternative to a dystopian future. In the <em>RADICAL COMPANIES</em> book we propose a model where companies are co-owned and co-managed by everybody who contributes to it, not just a few bosses. There are plenty of benefits of not having all decision-making centralized in the hands of one or a few people.  Unfortunately, it scares the bejesus out of bosses <em>and</em> employees. Bosses fear that their role and self-image are at risk; employees fear for their livelihood. Start ups and small companies in general are less scared of this model, but bigger or more established businesses can&rsquo;t even fathom it.</p>
 <p>Instead, we can try the co-ownership model in smaller bites. Like, an investment repayment fund or an annual bonus fund. Decentralizing these distributions gives everybody involved a taste of how they works and they may even see how it could be applied elsewhere, inside or outside the business.</p>

<h1>Repayment Fund</h1>
 <p>For example, an investor gives the company $200K to be repaid with 10% interest in two years. Normally, the interest belongs to the investor. But let&rsquo;s say that instead the company matches the 10% interest with an additional 10% to end up with a $40K fund. The money in the fund would then be distributed to everybody, including the investor, involved in repaying the investment using <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>

<h1>The Annual Bonus</h1>
 <p>The so-called <em>bonus</em><a id="bn01" href="#en01"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></a> is similar. The usual distribution is based on a whim or a formula.</p>
 <p>Often, it is done by the boss. &ldquo;This guy is very good and we have to make sure to keep him.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Other businesses, trying to be more progressive, establish a formula. This is usually based on years of experience, schooling level, tenure, and other so-called objective measures. I say so-called because in the end they are not always <em>objective</em> even if they are <em>measurable</em>. For example, a certain level schooling may not be necessary, but become part of the requirement because whoever wrote the requirement had a Masters degree from a brand university. &ldquo;Years of experience&rdquo; really means tenure at other, similar companies in similar jobs, but it doesn&rsquo;t account for other flavors of experience in other areas.</p>
 <p>If anything, what I&rsquo;ve called &ldquo;the boss&rsquo; whim&rdquo; is closer to recognizing <em>the value of contributions</em> and that is what <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s do.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RAD DISTRIBUTION</span>s</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD DISTRIBUTION</span>s<a id="bn02" href="#en02"><sup>2&nbsp;</sup></a> are all about recognizing contributions <em>and assigning them a value</em>. That is what the boss is doing in the privacy of his mind&mdash;nobody else knows if he is recognizing a contribution to the business&rsquo; bottom line, to the operations, or to his ego.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD DISTRIBUTION</span>s  do a similar thing, but lets everybody do it, not just the boss. They also assign a <em>tangible</em> value to each contribution that can later be translated to a percentage of, say, revenue, or a &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; fund, or an investment repayment fund. <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> Distributions are a tool for decentralizing the recognition of contributions. No central boss or formula needed for these distributions.</p>

<h1>Building Communities: Adjacent Software Projects</h1>
 <p>A young friend of mine is working a very different approach to programming that would make it easier to build sophisticated programs. It is not he typical architecture of tying together prebuild modules. He already has seeded other projects that have been embraced by developers, so this is bound to make a similar impact. The problem is that this kind of work is pretty lonely and there&rsquo;s never a community. There is, however, other work going on that's adjacent to it. That is where <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s can make a difference because <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s can help create a community</em>.</p>
 <p>My friend could seed a community with people who understands and believe and what he is doing, and people who are working on technology that may turn out to be relevant to his work. He would do that by inviting these people to his <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community of people who could help each other with feedback, critique, code, financial support, and whatever comes up.</p>
 <h2>Community as Pipeline</h2>
 <p>In particular to a software project, the community could end up trasforming prototypes into products. At a high level, in the software space, there are people who like ideas and writing about it; others like transforming ideas into prototypes; and still others who like to transform prototypes into products. But transforming protypes into products is where it gets messy because you have to form a copmpany to raise capital, then you get a Board, and your prototype-into-product intentions fall by the way side and you end up with a prototype-to-paying customers business. A lot of prople find that&hellip; not &ldquo;right.&rdquo; Nobody minds the money that comes along with all that, mind you. But they may not be comfortable with the <span class="_paradigm">FiAt</span> mindset and behavior that it requires.</p>
 <h2>Splitting the Treasure</h2>
 <p>With <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, you bypass the whole business/money/hierarchy stuff. My friend can from a community and the community deliver products. As revenue starts to come in, it can be distributed to the people who contributed to making it happen based on how many <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s each has been giving by their peers in the community.</p>
