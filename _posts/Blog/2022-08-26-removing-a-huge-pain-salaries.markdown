 <p>Salaries are a pain for salaried employees <span style="font-weight:bold; ">and</span> for the bosses who have to assign them.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Salaries are a pain for salaried people <span style="font-weight:bold; ">and</span> for the bosses who have to face them. Not only are they a pain, but the system is way too centralized, in the hands of bosses who have no idea what anybody really needs and have only a fuzzy, biased idea as to anybody&rsquo;s contribution. There is no way for bosses to be <em>fair</em> or for the employees to feel they are being treated fairly.</p>
 <p>The alternative is to let people set their own salaries.</p>

<h1>Salaries Are Labor Debt</h1>
 <p>Responsible adults know what they need, and everybody person you hire is a responsible adult. They are quite capable of figuring out how much they need to take home regularly; or put another way, they are quite capable of deciding how much to extract from the wealth that everybody helped create. This is what &ldquo;salaries&rdquo; should be: predictable and regular wealth extraction.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom:0; ">Salaries, on the other hand, are <em>not at all</em> wealth extraction today.</p>
 <p>The owners get to extract wealth from the business, the result of everybody&rsquo;s effort. Salaries are debt,
  <ul>
   <li>People do the work.</li>
   <li>This shows in the books as debt.</li>
   <li>The boss pays it at the going rate set by the labor market.</li>
   <li>The debt is erased.</li>
   <li>Eventually this goes to increase the <em>owners&rsquo;</em> equity. That is because &ldquo;labor&rdquo; creates present <em style="font-weight:bold; ">and</em> future value, so the today&rsquo;s labor ends up as owners&rsquo; equity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even the six-figure <em>salaries</em> that software developers can demand today<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a>, are a labor debt. If the business is sold tomrrow, the bosses and owners get to extract wealth from the sale, not the laborers. Of course, in some cases, as it is for some software developers, laborers get to extract a little bit of that wealth because they get business stocks. But that is the exception, not the rule.</p>
 
 <h1>So, Let&rsquo;s Give Everybody Stock!</h1>
  <p>Giving everybody stock is not the answer.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve worked in high tech my whole adult life. The early employees get stock, presumably in exchange for the risk they take. Then, at some point, new people get less and less stock, and finally none. And, it stands to reason: the &ldquo;employee pool&rdquo; is a fixed size and after a while it dries out. In any case, regardless of the stock class they get (<em>e.g.</em>, founder, common), employees don&rsquo;t get anything other than <em>stock-as-afinancial promise</em>. Only <em>officers and owners</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, capital investors) have any 1) control of the business itself and 2) get to extract real wealth from it (<em>e.g.</em>, a sale, loans against stock, sales of their stock). For example, patents belogn to the business and its worth is lost to the employee(s) who came up with it.</p>
  <p>Also,
   <ul>
    <li>Stocks are <em style="font-weight:bold; ">given</em> by the boss. They count towards <em>the compensation package</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, the labor market rate).</li>
    <li>Stocks are given as a <em>fixed mumber</em> of shares. Over time they are diluted as 1) more stock is issued and 2) the given stock becomes a smaller percentage of the total.</li>
    <li>Employees have no control over the stock price. Bosses do and they usually decide on the side of what is good for them, not employees.</li>
    <li>Employee level determines the amount of stock every member at the same level gets (<em>e.g.</em>, a Jr Engineer gets a fraction of what a Sr Engineer gets). All Jr Engineers get the same amount of stock and all Sr Engineers get the same amount of stock. This is true, regardless of their individual contributions. After a number of years, a Sr Engineer who contributes a lot has the same amount of stock as another Sr Engineer who barely does his job). The number of shares each gets is determined solely by their level in the hierarchy (<em>i.e.</em>, and, yes, the more aggressive people eak out a bit more shares, but this is based on their aggressiveness, not their contributions).</li>
    <li>Cooperatives, Unions, B Corps, and the like, are variations of <span>FIAT</span> businesses and, as such, they use the same type of stock as any other businesse.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The key problem is that the number of shares of stocks given is <em>not based on contributions</em>, it is totally arbitrary. It's better than a poke in the eye, but it's nowhere near fair to employees <em>or to the business</em> because it is not based on contributions.<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">3&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
