 <p>FIAT colonizes you in the most insidous ways. Sometimes, it doesn't let you eat a mandarin. It kills your buttefly by a thousand cuts.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>I have just been gifted this beautful story. It details how little by little you end up making your own life smaller and restricted. How you internalize the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> mindset and end up with a life interrupted, never letting yourself grow and mature.</p>
 <p>But you don&rsquo;t have to let belittle you. You can fly.</p>

<div class="_quotation">
 <p>I just came to a realization and I am writing you to flush it out in my own head.</p>
 <p>I&rsquo;ve realized that until a few days ago, I&rsquo;ve spent my whole life hurting myself emotionally. To give you an example, I&rsquo;ve always been the type of person that if I tried a new food and I didn&rsquo;t like it, I would still finish. I would think, &ldquo;you spent money on this, you have to make that money worth something.&rdquo;. Doing that, finishing it, would make it feel bad, but I felt I didn&rsquo;t have an option but to finish it even though I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying it. Recently, a friend told me told me that if I didn't like I didn't <em>have to</em> finish it, and I should feel bad about it either: I am trying something new and to find out if I enjoy it or not. If I don't like it, then I won't order it again next time.</p>
 <p>Her words made me realize that she was right, but I had normalized worrying about money most of all and putting money at the root of all my decisions. For big decision, that wasn't necessarily the case, but in the smaller, day-to-day decisions money was the overriding consideration.</p>
 <p>Since I left my home country I have bought mandarins only once. Once! And when went on sale, otherwise I would not have bought it. But in my home country I bought mandarins almost every day because it is my favority fruit. Here the litte voice in my head told me that I could have the pleasure because mandarins are too expensize and I couldn&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
 <p>These &ldquo;little&rdquo; decisions have been hurting me. They have made me feel bad and come to the conclusiong that I don't deserve the things I like. Survival has taken over and I have not been able to live my life according to what I feel I really want for myself. I am having a toxic relationships with myslef, making myself feel bad for a while and then trying to make up for it, to compensate: that has been the cycle of my life. I figured it has been this way because I am growing up in an environment when you accomplish something, you are not worth it of it, where accomplishment seems unreal, or maybe that was not an accomplishment after all and I should feel good or happy because something bad can happen and take it away.</p>
 <p>I am starting to realize that I am bringing myself down with a mindset of reward and punishment. I have also realized that I haven't had a quality life is and I've been afraid even thinking about it because of &ldquo;money.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Coming to this has made me stronger. I am more sure of myself and the little voice in my head can&rsquo;t derail me because I now understand that money is a means, not an end.</p>
 <p>I went to the supermarket two days ago and guess what: I bought mandarins, even though they weren't on sale!</p>
 <p>I am making small changes, one step at a time, and I feel I am on my way to live my own life. It is a bit ironic that it was that easy to do, although so difficult to realize how toxic conventional [<span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>] organizations are. Most ironic of all, I could not see how they affected me.</p>
 <p>My &ldquo;larva&rdquo; is on its way to become a butterfuly :)</p>
