   alt="The proposal readsâ€”what if a business 'going public' meant being converted into a cooperative. The #founder gets their cash payout for building something of value to the community by actually *selling* it to the community? Power to the people.">
 </div>
 <p>This means retaining some part of the company rather than selling the whole company to &ldquo;employees.&rdquo; Of course, rather than selling to a cooperative, this could a transitional situation towards a <class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span>, co-owned company.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>The shares of the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; and the shares sold to the &ldquo;employees&rdquo have the same rights.</li>
   <li>There is a Board, but no &ldquo;Chair.&rdquo;</li>
   <li>Every seat on the Board is turned over to a new person on a regular basis.</li>
   <li>All rules governing the Board, are determined by a Leadership Team outside the Board.</li>
   <li>There is no voting and decisions are made by consent, not consensus.</li>
   <li>If it ever comes to pass, the person with the most <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s is the tie breaker.</li>
  </ul>
