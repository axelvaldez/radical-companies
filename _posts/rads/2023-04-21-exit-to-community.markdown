 <p>Rather than selling the whole company to &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, selling the majority of it. Brilliant.</p>
 <p>It would also have to include,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>All shares have the same &ldquo;voting&rdquo; right.</li>
   <li>There is a Board, but no &ldquo;chair.&rdquo;</li>
   <li>Every seat gets a new person on a regular basis.</li>
   <li>The rules governing the Board, are determined outside the Board.</li>
   <li>Decisions are made by consent, not consensus. The person with the most RADs is the tie breaker.</li>
