   alt="The proposal readsâ€”what if a business 'going public' meant being converted into a cooperative. The #founder gets their cash payout for building something of value to the community by actually *selling* it to the community? Power to the people.">

 <p>The brilliant part is positioning it as an &ldquo;exit&rdquo;</p>
 <p>This could become a transitional situation towards co-owned, <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> companiesa.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The shares of the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; and the shares sold to the &ldquo;employees&rdquo have the same rights.</li>
   <li>There is a Board, but no &ldquo;Chair.&rdquo; Think of it as a recurring Leadership Team that meets the requirements of a Board of Directors.</li>
   <li>Every seat on the Board is turned over to a new person on a regular basis. Of course, the people in the company can decide otherwise and, for example, gibve the old &ldquo;owner&rdquo; a permenent seat at the table. That is dangerous. An alternative would be to give the old &ldquo;owner&rdquo; a Board seat for a given number of years.</li>
   <li>All rules governing the Board, are determined by a team outside the Board.</li>
   <li>There is no voting. Decisions are made by consent, not consensus.</li>
   <li>If it ever comes to pass, the person with the most <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s is the tie breaker.</li>
  </ul>
