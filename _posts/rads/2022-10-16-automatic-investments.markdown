 <p>What if you want to invest your money-through-<span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> for more than one cycle&rsquo;s worth. And you want to do it automatically?</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>What if, for example, I want to invest <em>more</em> of the money I get in <em>earned dividends</em>?Or, what if I want to commit <em>N percent</em>  of my <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s income to a project? And you want to do it automatically?</p>
 <p>In these cases, I can express that I want to invest <em>N</em> or <em>N percent</em> of my <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> income to a co-owner for, say, the next three cycles. Or I could express that I want to invest some of it to a specific <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span> for as long as it is up.</p>
 <p>This way I can invest in another co-owner, project, or cause, automatically, over a period of time.</p>
