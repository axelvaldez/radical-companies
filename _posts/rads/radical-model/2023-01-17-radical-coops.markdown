<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Co-ops could be based on the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model. Kind of.</p>
 <p>It&rsquo;d be failry straight forward to do if we break the &ldquo;one person, one vote&rdquo; rule and swich to a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s-based system. This system would be based on contributions, not absolute equality.</p>

<h1>Why <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s Then?</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>You could still give your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to BANNERSs. For example, if somebody puts up a BANNER to clean and beautify a nearby river walk, you could give the yield of some of your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to it.</li>
  <li>When somebody leaves the co-op, they take their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s with them. They earned them and they continue to get whatever is factored through these <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. But they don’t receive any new <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. Given that the total <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s goes up every day. This means that the fixed number a person takes with him goes down as a percentage of total <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</li>
  <li>Co-ops would be based on contributions.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>And Co-Management?</h1>
 <p>That was equal co-ownership, regardless of contributions, but co-ownership nevertheless. So, what about co-management?</p>
 <p>Co-ops generally have t<span class="_paradigm">rad</span>itional <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchies in place. In Italy, many (most?) co-ops have had the same bosses for many, many years. Mondragon, in Spain, has alway had a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy in place. “But they are elected by the community.” Yes, but it ain’t co-management because it is managed by a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy. It still carries the presumption that the little people need a boss to tell them what to do.</p>
 <p>My guess is that of the co-ops that decide to go <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> they will try co-management, and at least a few will adopt it permanently.</p>
