 <p>Collaboration and cooperation are close, but not the same.</p></p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Collaboration and cooperation are close, but not the same. They are both about working with others, but,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Collaboration aims <em>to achieve shared goals</em>.</li>
   <li>Cooperation aims <em>to achieve your own goals</em>.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Cooperation is what the <span class='_paragigm'>FIAT</span> ownership imposes via capital. Collaboration, on the other hand, is part of our evolvution and we still do today, naturally, via contributions.</p>
