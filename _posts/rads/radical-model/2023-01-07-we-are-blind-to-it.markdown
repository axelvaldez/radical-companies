 <p>Today the problem is not the colonialism of distant lands. The BIG problem is the self-colonialism of our minds which makes us blind to the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>.</p>

<h1>Colonialism</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Today the problem is not colonialism of distant lands.</li>
  <li>Today the problem is not the colonialism of distant lands.</li>
  <li>The BIG problem is the self-colonialism of our minds which makes us blind to the <span clasThe BIG problem is the self-colonialism of our minds which makes us blind to the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>.</p>
 </ul>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> Hierarchy</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>We assume that the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy is forever and cannot be changed.</li>
  <li>We feel the problems, but canâ€™t see the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system as the source of it all.</li>
  <li>We haven&lsquo;t even had a name for it.</li>
  <li>We are blind to it.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Co-Management</h1>
 <p>To start to move away from <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>, consider co-management (scary),</p>
 <ul>
  <li>No bosses or employees</li>
  <li>Decentralized management</li>
  <li>Everybody is a co-manager</li>
  <li><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s and <em>RADs!</em> app</li>
  <li>Explicit alignment</li>
  <li>Other <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Tools</li>
  <li>Everybody is a co-manager</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Then consider co-ownership (scarier),</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Ownership is a human invention and a good one at that.</li>
  <li>The problem is <em>centralized</em> ownership.</li>
  <li>Co-ownership is decentralized.</li>
  <li>Co-ownership recognizes contributions</li>
  <li>Co-ownership accounts for contributions (as <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s)</li>
  <li>Co-ownership makes contributions tangible (by factoring benefits through <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s).</li>
  <li>Everybody is a co-owner</li>
 </ul>
