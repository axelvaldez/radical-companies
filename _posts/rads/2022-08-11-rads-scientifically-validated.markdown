 <p>Ten years of research say that RADs are right.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>In a Harvard Business Revue article, <span style="font-style:italic; "><em>The Neuroscience of Trust</em></span>, the author, Paul Zak, says that &ldquo;it’s clear that creating an employee-centric culture can be good for business.&rdquo;<a id="bm01" href="#en01"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></a> Employee-centric cultures, in turn, are based on trust and these are the eight behaviors that promote it,

    <p>&ldquo;The neuroscience shows that recognition has the largest effect on trust when it occurs immediately after a goal has been met, when it comes from peers, and when it’s tangible, unexpected, personal, and public.&rdquo;</p>

 <p>He concludes that,
  <div class="_quotation">&hellip;those working in high-trust companies enjoyed their jobs 60% more, were 70% more aligned with their companies’ purpose, and felt 66% closer to their colleagues. &hellip; Compared with employees at low-trust organizations, the high-trust folks had 11% more empathy for their workmates, depersonalized them 41% less often, and experienced 40% less burnout from their work. They felt a greater sense of accomplishment, as well—41% more.</div>
