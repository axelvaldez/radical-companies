 <p>The latest and easiest way we've found to recognize others&rsquo; contributions with RADs.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>In the book <em><span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL COMPANIES</span></em><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> we mentioned various ways of deploying <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s, but we were generally vague because we had no experience with them.</p>
 <p>We now have a mobile app to help us with the RAD distribution<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>. We have build some experience with it and we can at least go through one specific example.</p>

    alt="Two screenshots from the RADs! Distribution mobile app. The screenshots show the two tabs the app has; the left tab, labeled co-owners, shows the people who are included in my team; the right tab shows people that have been invited to the use the app. I can give RADs to people in either list."

 <p>Note that a long push of the left and right arrows brings up a list of communities you are a member of so you can jump directly to it.</p>

<h1>How the <span class='_paradigm'>GIVE</span> Button Works</h1>
 <ol>
  <li>You press the GIVE button to recognize a peer&rsquo;s contribution.</li>
  <li>You can press the GIVE button as many times as you want to reflect how you feel about their contribution.</li>
  <li>Once you ease off on the GIVE button, a note box will come up so you can let your peer and the other co-owners know <em>why</em> you are giving them <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s</li>
  <li>When you submit the note, a notification shows up on their device letting them know that they&rsquo;ve been recognized, along with the note.</li>
 </ol>

<h1>How <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s Are Calculated</h1>
 <p>What you are really doing with this app is recognizing your peers&rsquo; contributions<a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> (<em>i.e.</em>, <em>Meaning</em>)</a>. You can press the <em>hand</em> recognition button as much as you want; the app takes care of calculating the actual number of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s that your peer will get.</p>
 <p>The calculation is based on your cycle, which could be monthly, or weekly, or quarterly, or whatever. In any case, the calculation is very simple,</p>
 <p class="_center">
  <img

   alt="The picture depicts a simple equation. As recognitions come in, the app divided the number of recognitions per person by the total number of recognitions I have given. This is multiplied by the number of RADs I have received during this cycle. The result is the number of RADs I am giving to each of my peers."

<h1>How the <span class='_paradigm'>LET&rsquo;S TALK</span> Button Works</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Press the <span class='_paradigm'>LET&rsquo;S TALK</span> button (<em>i.e.</em>, once per topic).</li>
  <li>After you press it, a note box will come up for you to write a note, private to you, of the particular topic.</li>
  <li>Once you save the note, a notification shows up on their device letting them know that you&rsquo;d like to talk.</li>
  <li>It is a good practice to propose, or ask for, a day and time.</li>
  <li>If you press it more than once with the same private note, the person at the other end will receive one notification. On the other hand, writing a different note will fire another notification.<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></li>
