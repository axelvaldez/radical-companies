 <p>A <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span> is a dimensionless unit that measure contribution. Any kind of contribution, not just financial.</p>
</div>

<h1>What Are RADs?</h1>
 <p>A <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span> is a dimensionless unit and people measure their contributions with <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s. They represent any kind of contribution, not just financial.</p>
 <p>Money has a fixed value, and stocks represent a fixed percentage of a property. <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are dynamic and the percentage of them any co-owner has changes from cycle to cycle (<em>e.g.</em>, monthly).</p>
 <p>As an accounting tool, <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s account for has previously been unaccountable: individual contributions. They allow us to get away from &ldquo;equal&rdquo; and make things truly &ldquo;equitable.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Giving RADs</h1>
 <p>Co-owners then get to give <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s according to their individual judgment. Each decides how many <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s to give to other co-owners as recognition for their contributions.</p>
 <p>The value of the whole emerges from the judgment of the many.</p>
 <p>A few important observations about <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>,</p>
 <ul>
  <li><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are not a currency. A RAD has no intrinsic value.</li>
  <li>The giving criteria is completely up to each person.</li>
  <li><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s represent <em>dynamic</em> ownership. One month you may give me all your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s, but the next month you may not give me any.</li>
  <li>To calculate your percentage ownership, divide the number of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you have been given by the total number of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s.</li>
  <li><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s aggregate from cycle to cycle. The absolute number of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s allocated to me either stays the same or goes up at every cycle, but it never goes down.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, my <em>percentage</em> of the total could go up, stay the same, or go down at every cycle.</li>
  <li>When revenue comes into the company later it is disbursed as a function of the number of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s each person has.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Getting RADs</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Co-owners get one RAD per day.</li>
  <li>These <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are to give, not to keep.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Recognizing Contributions</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>There is a mobile <em>RADs! app</em> to make it easy to give <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s on your phone.</li>
  <li>Co-owners get to press a button in <em>the RADs! app</em> whenever they want to <em>recognize contributions.</em> They can press this <em>recognition</em> button as many times as they feel like.</li>
  <li>At the end of the cycle, <em>the RADs! app</em> converts these recognitions to <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s.</li>
 </ul>
 <div class="_center">

   alt="This is a formula to convert recognized contributions to RADs. The app calculates a ratio of the number of contributions you recognized for each co-owner divided by the  total percentage of contributions you have recognized during the cycle. This ratio is then multiplied by the number of RADs accumulated in the cycle. The result is the number of RADs given to a each co-owner.">
 </div>

<h1>Teaching RADs</h1>
 <p>People are the best judges of what a contribution is. Sure, they may grant <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s and later regret it. In fact, that change of heart might have come as result of a conversation with other co-owners. That is how people learn!</p>
 <p>One more thing: As people share and grant each other <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s, they also learn the value of <em>what they&rsquo;re building together</em> at a visceral level.</p>

<h1>Receiving RADs</h1>
 <p>The number of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you have determines your level of co-ownership.</p>
 <p>In a FIAT business, profits belong to the owners. In a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>s company, profits belong to co-owners based on the amount of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s they have. </p>

<h1>Cheatin&rsquo; RADs</h1>
  <p class="_q">Can this easily become a tit-for-tat exchange?</p>
  <div class="_a">
   <p>RAD-giving is transparent. If I give you all my <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s and you give me all your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s, that is out there for all other co-owners to see. It is up to them to ask if they think that&rsquo;s suspicious. Remember: you are a co-owner, you don&rsquo;t need &ldquo;protection&rdquo; for asking questions.</p>
    <p>Maybe what looks like a tit-for-tat has a perfectly good explanation, <span class="_quotespan_">Weird! I didn&rsquo;t realize that was happening. I gave him all my <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s because she did&hellip; </span>.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="_q">Can this become a popularity contest?</p>
  <div class="_a">
   <p>Maybe you are &ldquo;popular&rdquo; and get lots of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s because,</p>
    <ul>
     <li>You made an extraordinary contribution that everybody noticed.</li>
     <li>You share my knowledge with what seems like everybody.</li>
     <li>You suggested a change to our strategy that benefitted everybody.</li>
    </ul>
   <p>In these cases, the &ldquo;popularity&rdquo; is earned and it is not a problem. It is healthy. The unhealthy form of &ldquo;popularity&rdquo; is something that can only happen in <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> business, but very difficult to imagine happening in a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> company.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>I talk a lot and contribute little.</li>
     <li>I am a very good looking man or woman.</li>
     <li>(The boss likes me.)</li>
    </ul>
   <p>In these cases, co-owners can see what happens and, I hope, challenge the toxicity.</p>
