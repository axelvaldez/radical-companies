 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s were given to me in recognition of <em>my</em> contributions. Gifting my <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to someone else doesnt seem right. But then again, they were given to me without any strings attached.</p>
 <p>Rather, I could trade <em>the money</em> that&rdquo;s factored through it for booze, but <em>the RADs</em> themselves? It doesn&rdquo;t seem to be much of a difference, but it is a good difference to keep in mind.</p>

<h1>RADs vs Results</h1>
 <p>Matt believes that it is fine to give the money or whatever results from the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, but not the RADs themselves. The assignment is transparent and anybody can see it. &ldquo;Whatever factors through these <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, goes to&hellip; .&rdquo;</p>
 <p>The results of your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are always assigned to you. What we are doing is separating the RADs from results so you can change them separately.</p>
 <p>By not gifting the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, you can always reassign what factors though them. For example, you could assign the results to somebody for three months, then reassign them to a cause for a year, and finally reassign the results back to you. If you gifted your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, you would not be able to do this.</p>
