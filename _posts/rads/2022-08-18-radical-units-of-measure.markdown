 <p>We need a recognition unit of measure in additons to RADs.</p>
</div>

<h1>Units of Measure</h1>
 <p>In our book, <em><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL COMPANIES</span></em><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> we came up with <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s as a unit of <em>distribution</em>. It turns out that we also need a unit of <em>recognition</em>.</p>

<h1>A Unit of Distribution</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s account for the unaccountable because they quantify contributions as recognized by co-owners. <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are not at all connected to hours or title or any such.</p>
 <p>At distribution time the percentage of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s you have factors the amount of, say, Earned Dividends you get.</p>
 <p>As we tried to use <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s in the first version of the <em>RADs! app</em>, it got too clumsy and cumbersome. We would end up adding and subtracting <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s: exactly what we didn&rsquo;t want. We wanted to capture the <em>feeling instensity</em> that a contribution by one co-owner brought up in another co-owner.</p>
 
<h1>A Unit of Recognition</h1>
 <p>To make the process, and the app, easier to use, we needed a unit of recognition. So we changed the app!</p>
 <p>The <em>RADs! app</em> now lets co-owners press a recognition button as many times as they feels like it. This captures the <em>feeling intensity</em> we wanted.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom:0; ">At the end of the cycle, the <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s! app</em> converts recognitions to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s,
  <ul>
   <li>The number of recognitions co-owners Barbara gave a particular co-owneris divided by the total recognitions she gave during the period.</li>
   <li>Each resulting percentage is then multiplied by the total number of days in the cycle (<em>i.e.</em>, co-owners get one <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> per day).</li>
   <li>This results in the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s each co-owner got from Barbara.</li>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <div style="text-align:center; ">

   alt="This is a formula. Its input is 'feelings about contributions.' In the middle, the number of recognitions per co-owner divided by the total number of recognitions given during the cycle. This is then multiplied by the number of days in the cycle. The result is the number of RADs each co-owner gets.">
