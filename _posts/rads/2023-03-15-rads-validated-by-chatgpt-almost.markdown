 <p>We asked chatGPT and it got really close to describing <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. But it source data wouldn&rsquo;t let it get past the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> model.</p>

    <th>ChatGPT</th>
    <td>
     <div class="_quotespan">One possible mechanism that does not involve community, government, or politics to decide when unused resource units expire could be a market-based approach.</div>
     <div class="_quotespan">Under this approach, individuals could trade their resource units with each other on a decentralized marketplace. The expiration date for each unit could be determined by the seller, and buyers would be able to choose which units to purchase based on the expiration date that best suits their needs.</div>
     <div class="_quotespan"><span class="_continue_"></span>For example, if an individual needs resource units to access healthcare services in the near future, they may choose to purchase units with a shorter expiration date, while if another individual wants to invest in a longer-term project, they may choose to purchase units with a longer expiration date.</div>
     <div class="_quotespan"><span class="_continue_"></span>The expiration date for each unit could be determined based on supply and demand dynamics on the marketplace. Units with shorter expiration dates may be in higher demand and therefore command a higher price, while units with longer expiration dates may be in lower demand and therefore command a lower price.</div>
     <div class="_quotespan"><span class="_continue_"></span>While this approach would not involve community, government, or politics to determine expiration dates, it would require the development of a decentralized marketplace platform that is secure, reliable, and accessible to all individuals. Additionally, it would require individuals to have a certain level of financial literacy and access to digital technologies in order to participate in the marketplace.</div>

    <th>Question</th>
    <td>
     <div class="_quotespan">What do you think of an institution in a business where everyone in the company receives an equal fraction of the profits, but has to give them to other people? They cannot keep the fraction for themselves.</div>

     <div class="_quotespan">The idea of a company where everyone receives an equal fraction of the profits but must give it away to other people is an interesting concept. It could potentially create a culture of giving and generosity within the company, and encourage employees to think beyond their own interests and needs.</div>
     <div class="_quotespan"><span class="_continue_"></span>However, there are several potential challenges and considerations to keep in mind with this approach. For example:</div>
     <div class="_quotespan"><span class="_continue_"></span>Motivation and incentive: If employees are not allowed to keep any of the profits for themselves, they may be less motivated to work hard and contribute to the success of the company. Without a direct financial incentive, employees may not be as invested in the company's success, which could lead to lower productivity and lower overall profits.</div>
     <div class="_quotespan"><span class="_continue_"></span>Administration and logistics: Distributing profits to others would require a significant amount of administration and logistics to ensure that the money is being distributed fairly and effectively. This could be difficult to manage, especially if the recipients of the profits are not clearly defined or if there are disagreements over who should receive the funds.</div>
     <div class="_quotespan"><span class="_continue_"></span>Legal and regulatory considerations: There may be legal and regulatory considerations to take into account with this approach, such as tax laws, labor laws, and securities regulations. Companies would need to ensure that they are complying with all relevant laws and regulations to avoid any legal or financial repercussions.</div>
     <div class="_quotespan"><span class="_continue_"></span>Overall, while the idea of a company where everyone receives an equal fraction of the profits but must give it away to others is an interesting concept, it may not be practical or feasible in all situations. It would require careful planning and consideration to ensure that it achieves the desired outcomes without creating unintended consequences or challenges.</div>

<h1>Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt</h1>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s try and address some of the things that came up in these answers,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_background">
   <tr>
    <th>Market-based approach</th>
    <td>
     <p>The assumption here is of a <em>perfectly open market</em>. Unfortunately, there is no such thing: markets are gamed by big capital players, governments, etc&mdash;mild forms of force.</p>
     <p>It seems that the data source chatGPT uses is biased towards this assumption of &ldquo;perfection.&rdquo; Unfortunately, this makes this response meaningless in the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> context.</p>
     <p>A market is not a solution.</p>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Expiration Date</th>
    <td>
     <p>This had us going until we realized that 1) &ldquo;expiration date&rdquo; is a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> concept that involves negotiating, convincing, etc., and 2) instead we have a built-in <em>change rate</em> for <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>
     <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are created evey day, so the <em>percentage</em> of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s that you own changes ever day. A new co-owner make may outstanding contributions and in a short time end up with a large percentage of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Motivation and Incentive</th>
    <td>
     <p>Maybe the question mislead chatGPT, but one of the aspect of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s is you get one every day, but if for you to give to other people, you don&rsquo;t keep.</p>
     <p>If you believe that we are all <em>homo economicus</em> and our main motivation is money, then the motivation is to contribute because that translates into <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>
     <p>If instead you believe, like we do, that money came after we have evolved to homo sapiens, the you are motivated to contribute <em>because it gives you satisfaction</em>. In other words, one way or the other, the motivation is there. We believe that people bring their motivation with them when they aim to make an impact.</p>
     <p>The homo economicus concept confuses <em>motivation to work</em> when it really is <em>motivation to survive</em>. And when survival is based on how much money you have to spend&hellip;</p>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Administration and logistics</th>
    <td>
     <p>We have a Open Source (free) <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> mobile app that does all the administration and logistics needed. You could also do it with stones, if it came to it.</p>
     <p>The point is that &ldquo;administration and logistics&rdquo; is a default <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s excuse for not doing something.</p>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Legal and Regulatory</th>
    <td>
     <p>OK, this is a fair concern: we have not done anything about the legal aspect of this or about <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s tax implications. Whenever that comes up we either skip to the next topic or handwave furiously as <span class="_quotespan">we&rsquo;ll deal with that later.</span></p>
     <p>We defintely need to talk with competent <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>s lawyers and have them come up with a contract that 1) protects the work of the community, 2) the co-owners from frivolous attacks, and 3) keeps co-owners squared up with their taxes.</p>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>It may not be practical or feasible</th>
    <td>
     <p>This is another default <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>s system reaction to anything that is perceived as an existential threat. <span class="_quotespan">Be very afraid. Walk away before you get hurt.</span></p>
     <p>An alternative to <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> is practical, feasible, and <em>necessary</em>. And it is a better option for business individually and the overall economy. We admit that it is a bad alternative if all you have is capital and can&rsquo;t offer anything else.</p>
