 <p>We asked chatGPT and it got really close to describing <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. But it source data wouldn&rsquo;t let it get past the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> model.</p>

<!--
ChatGPT: One possible mechanism that does not involve community, government, or politics to decide when unused resource units expire could be a market-based approach.

Under this approach, individuals could trade their resource units with each other on a decentralized marketplace. The expiration date for each unit could be determined by the seller, and buyers would be able to choose which units to purchase based on the expiration date that best suits their needs.

For example, if an individual needs resource units to access healthcare services in the near future, they may choose to purchase units with a shorter expiration date, while if another individual wants to invest in a longer-term project, they may choose to purchase units with a longer expiration date.

The expiration date for each unit could be determined based on supply and demand dynamics on the marketplace. Units with shorter expiration dates may be in higher demand and therefore command a higher price, while units with longer expiration dates may be in lower demand and therefore command a lower price.

While this approach would not involve community, government, or politics to determine expiration dates, it would require the development of a decentralized marketplace platform that is secure, reliable, and accessible to all individuals. Additionally, it would require individuals to have a certain level of financial literacy and access to digital technologies in order to participate in the marketplace.
