</div>

<h1><span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> Storytellers</h1>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> companies might have one person who communicates their work very well and another who does not. This happens in many organizations, but there is never an attempt to help others learn how to do it well. In a <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> company we can notice that quickly, just by looking at the distribution of RADs.</p>
 <p>As a co-owners, I could, for instance, walk around to people who have low RADs and ask them about it. Maybe they are incompetent, but maybe they are just mediocre at making others aware of their accomplishments.</p>
 <p>I can help to make them shine. I can speak on their behalf and be part of workshops that demonstrate what he is doing and get her work out there. I can also help learn the skills to do it on her own.</p>
 <p>I would likely get <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s for that and the satisfaction of making their work shine.</p>
 <p>I could basically be the co-owner who does TEDx Talk style publishing for other co-owners.</p>

<h1>The <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> Model</h1>
 <p>In <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> organizations, this is supposed to be done by your manager, or Human Resources (HR) sends you to a training course, if you are high-level enough. Your boss may be pretty bad at communications, too, or he may not mentor you well for fear that you&rsquo;ll leap over him. The HR course may turn out to be ineffective or even counterproductive. </p>
 <p>Beware that, for a number of reasons, you might instead get punished for &ldquo;not doing enough.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>The <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> Model</h1>
 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> model breaks you free from that. People are eager to help each other learn new skills, like communications because the behavior is rewarded by RADs, but more importantly, by the satisfaction of being able to help others learn new skills. The rewards of a learning, sharing organization abound.</p>

<h1>They Key</h1>
 <p>The things that make this possible is,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Transparency of the RAD Distribution</li>
   <li>The personal and organizational satisfaction of allowing people to grow how <em>they</em> want to grow.</li>
   <li>Increasing people&rsquo;s senses of <span class='_paradigm'>Belonging</span>: In this case, the <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> Storyteller and the people who want to learn to communicate better.</li>
  </ul>
