 <p><span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> Storytellers can help co-owners</p>
</div>

<h1><span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> Storytellers</h1>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> companies might have one person who communicates their work very well and another who does not. This happens in many organizations, but there is never an effort for people who do it well to help others learn the skills. In a <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> company we can notice that quickly, just by looking at the distribution of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s. A co-owner skilled in story-telling can either do it other co-owners or help them learn the skillset.</p>
 <p>As a co-owners, I could, for instance, walk around to people who have low <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s and ask them about it. Maybe they are incompetent, but maybe they are just mediocre at making others aware of their accomplishments.</p>
 <p>I can help to make them shine. I can speak on their behalf and be part of workshops that demonstrate what they are doing and get their work out there. I can also help learn learn the skills to do it on their own.</p>
 <p>I would likely get <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s for that and the satisfaction of making their work shine.</p>
 <p>I could basically be a co-owner who helps other co-owners.</p>

<h1>The <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> Model</h1>
 <p>In <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> organizations, this is supposed to be done by your manager, or Human Resources (HR). If you are high-level enough, they can even send you to a training course. Your boss may be pretty bad at communications himself or he may not mentor you well for fear that you&rsquo;ll leap over him. The HR course may turn out to be ineffective or even counterproductive.</p>
 <p>In many cases, you might instead get punished for &ldquo;not doing enough.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>The <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> Model</h1>
 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> model breaks you free from this. Co-owners want to help each other learn new skills&mdash;since thet co-own the company and any improvement benefits them.</p>

<h1>They Key</h1>
 <p>The things that make this possible is,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Transparency of the <span class='_paradigm'>RAD Distribution</span>.</li>
   <li>The satisfaction of helping people grow how <em>they</em> want to grow.</li>
   <li>Increasing people&rsquo;s senses of <span class='_paradigm'>Belonging</span>.</li>
  </ul>
