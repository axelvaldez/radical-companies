 <p>Dictatorships are bad for the economy. For example, look at Cuba, North Korea, and Russia.</p>

 <p>Dictatorships <em>have to</em> become kleptocracies to fund private goods (<em>aka</em>, corruption) at the expense of public goods.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> Take, for example, Russia, North Korea, and Cuba: they have enough of an economy to fund the violence necessary to maintain tbeir dictatoships in power, but not enough to do maintenance of their infrastructure.</p>
 <p>Dictatorships are repugnant, but are they <em>illegal</em>? There is no  international law to declare them illegal, so everything they do is&hellip; undefined.</p>
 <p>At the business level, national laws make businesses legal. Given that businesses are <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> dictatorships, with all the power centralized in the hands of the owners, having owners collect all the profits is legal. But, I claim, not even the best way to grow wealth.</p>
 <p>The brilliance of the stock market is the realization that it takes a community to grow. In this case, it was a community of well-to-do people with capital to help businesses grow, but a community nevertheless,<p>
 <p class="_quotation">1790: The Philadelphia Stock Exchange is formed, helping spur the development of the U.S.’s financial sectors and the country’s expansion west.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">2&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>The US Constitution "all men are created equal" was signed by slavers, but it has progressed since then. On the other hand, the stock market has been pretty much stuck, in spite of weak attempts to broaden its base. Over time, ruthless competition and predatory practices have developed and has limited its healthy growth.</p>
 <p>Of note, <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies and organizations will be incubated <em>inside</em> the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system. In time this will transform the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system itself.</p>
