  <p>You have to distinguish between the CEO and every other manager, or as well call them the Big Boss and Lesser Bosses.</p>

<h1>The Hierarchy</h1>
 <h2>The Big Boss</h2>
  <p>You have to distinguish between the CEO and every other manager, or as well call them the Big Boss and Lesser Bosses.</p>
  <p>The Big Boss could be any of,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A founder (<em>e.g.</em>, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos)</li>
   <li>A career Lesser Boss (<em>e.g.</em>, Tim Cook, Andy Jassy) who is elevated to Big Boss.</li>
   <li>A monied type who elevates himself to Big Boss (<em>e.g.</em>, Elon Musk).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Big Boss sits at the top of the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy, the boss of the Lesser Bosses.</p>
 <h2>The Lesser Bosses</h2>
  <p>No matter the size of the business, the Lesser Bosses compete with each other, more or less furiously. There are exceptions to this, but this is the norm; the exceptions are few and far between.</p>

<h1>The Big Boss</h1>
 <h2>Rasing Capital</h2>
  <p>TBD</p>
 <h2>Hiring</h2>
  <p>Putting together the Executive team is way up there in the Big Boss&rsquo; job description; it goes right under <em>make money for the board and the stockholder.</em></p>
  <p>If you are within striking distance of an IPO or some other &ldquo;liquidity event,&rdquo; you hire a bunch of people with bona fide credentials from well known companies. You name them CxOs because a big part of your IPO story is having &ldquo;a strong team.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If you are far from IPO, or past it, you want to hire an &ldquo;effective&rdquo; team, no matter how they go about it, even if they go about it ruthlessly. And when it comes to finances they will get you what you need one way or the other.</p>
  <p>In a smaller company, the Big Boss&rsquo; main job is to raise money and set strategy. So, he hires an executive team who can take care of everything else. These folks are mostly competent and even nice (but they are their way of being neither).</p>
 <h2>Firing</h2>
  <p>It may be distasteful and a mark against the Big Boss. &ldquo;He made a mistake, he should have never hired such a duffus.&rdquo; Or it may be something to be proud of. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t hesitate! This guy can really execute.&rdquo; Either way, it is usually not a big deal as the Lesser Boss is given a generous severance in exchange for a signed promise not to sue the business.</p>
 <h2>Strategy</h2>
  <p>Whether they think of it or they take it from someone else, the Big Boss sets the strategy. When it is all said and done, the strategy is how the company is going to make a bigger profit. &ldquo;The way we are going to grow&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<h1>The Lesser Bosses</h1>
 <h2>Hiring</h2>
  <p>Except for their direct staff, the Lesser Bosses get involved in hiring just in case their boss asks. They really add no value to the process. In fact, they slow it down. After &ldquo;looking for a time that will work for the boss,&rdquo; they do a very short &ldquo;interview&rdquo; and render a decision to hire or not. This is after several interviews by the team of people who know the subject matter and are going to work with the candidate. Many go with the team&rsquo;s decision, but others don&rsquo;t, because &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like her&hellip; &rdquo; &ldquo;&hellip;  attitude,&rdquo; &ldquo;&hellip; way of playing with her drealocks&rdquo;, &ldquo;&hellip; posture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a co-managed company, the people who are going to team up with the candidate make the final decision to hire or not. They may even do away with the interview altogether because the candidate is not just a vessel of cognitive skills, the rest of her comes along with it.</p>
 <h2>Firing</h2>
  <p>Firing is usually left to the Lesser Boss. Many of them dislike doing it, so they ignore it or postpone doing it until things come to a head. In a co-managed company, the team can eject a person and tell him the reasons why directly. No boss needed.</p>
 <h2>Mediating Conflict</h2>
  <p>The Lesser Bosses play referee often. If there&rsquo;s a conflict between people, he gets in the middle of it and does his best to arrive at a clean break. This general does not resolve the issue, not really, but everybody can go to their own corners to work.</p>
  <p>In a co-managed company, either people resolve the issue themselves or they involve a third person and the three of them resolve the issue. By the end of it every one learns new skills for how to resolve this type of issue and, more importantly, new language to keep it from becoming a problem.</p>
 <h2>Defending You From Other Bosses</h2>
  <p>Each department in a business is kind of like a feudal dominion, a castle if you will: it is siloed, has a moat around it, and you work in exchange for protection (plus a paycheck).</p>
  <p>The would-be attackers are the other bosses, and sometimes the people, in the other castles&hellip; er&hellip; departments. The knight in white armor &ldquo;defending&rdquo; you is your boss.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ll leave it to you, dear reader, to imagine the many ways that this becomes an obstacle to collaboration and the (negative) impact it has on the business.</p>
 <h2>Implementing Tactics</h2>
  <p>Technically, the Lesser Bosses set the tactics to implement the Top Boss strategy.</p>
  <p>In reality, the thing that counts the most is the financial goals. The grander strategy may or may not align with the profit-making goals and, when in doubt, meet the profit goals and the rest is forgiven.</p>
  <p>You are the proverbial cog and your job is to,</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Implement the profit-making goals</li>
   <li>Maybe implement the tactics that your boss set.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Unfortunately, you usually have no idea how what you do connects to the profit-making goals, or the tactics, or the strategy. Your job is whatever your boss says it is, and everything else is a black box to you.</p>
  <p>In a co-managed company, everything about the company is transparent. So you can figure out how what you do ties to your company&rsquo;s sustainability (<em>i.e.</em>, financials, strategy, tactics, etc.).</p>
 <h2>Other Things&hellip;</h2>
  <p>The Lesser Bosses are, in theory, responsible for many, many other things. But, as often as not, these go undone or are done sporadically because the Lesser Bosses spend their time doing one thing or another for their bosses.</p>

<h1>Decentralizing the Bosses</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy is hostile to doing business. It makes innovation nearly impossible. A tremendous amount of money and effort is wasted on the hierachy and &ldquo;control theater,&rdquo;. Companies can become immediately more efficient by letting go of the illusion of control and letting people co-manage themselves.

   <td>
    <p>Except in the most bureaucratic businesses, hiring <em>already</em> is done by the hiring team; the Lesser Boss involvement is mostly a ritual and adds no value to this process.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Firing</th>
   <td>
    <p>Firing can be done by the team as well. Learning to give feedback doesn&rsquo;t come natural, even to bosses. Today, we practice a language of competition and dominance and we need to learn a language of love, empathy, and support. And not just for &ldquo;firing&rdquo;, but in general.</p>
    <p>For a whole socienty, this is going to be a long process. But each company can do it more quickly by the process of aculturation. Among other things, this helps build trust more quickly.</p>

    <p>Besides, without a hierarchy you don&rsquo;t need to be &ldquo;defended&rdquo;. We all need to learn to take in what others say as feedback, something to learn from. Feedback is about us and about them. And, yes, this is different and will feel strange at first, but it is our chance to evolve.</p>
