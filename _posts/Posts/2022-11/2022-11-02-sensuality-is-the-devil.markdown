<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The serpent that tempted Eve to convince Adam to bite the apple. That snake represents sensuality and life. That effort to eliminate sensualith eventuall went counter to the preservation of life.</p>

<h1>Bad for the survival of society</h1>
 <p>But why, oh why, was sensuality depicted as bad for the preservation of life? My guess is that early societies saw that sensuality led to the exhaustion of the young people who did the bulk of the work to feed the tribe. It also leads to the deaths of women and oftentimes the child. And, when things went well, it resulted in more mouths to feed. In summary, from their point of view, sensuality had a lot of negatives,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Work loss.</li>
   <li>Potential loss of young people.</li>
   <li>The pain of loss.</li>
   <li>More mouths to feed.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>This was not good for those early societies. Sensuality was Satan! Several thousand years later, conditions have changed and the threat to life is the <em>lack of</em> sensuality and warm relationships.</p>

<h1>Renouncing the Snake</h1>
 <p>Given that we don&rsquo;t know any different, let&rsquo;s assume that renouncing the sensuality-as-snake preserved and improved life. However, the scaffolding turned against the very impact we wanted to accomplish: we erected it to preserve human life, but the scaffolding just wanted to preserve its life.</p>

<h1>The Shaman is the Boss</h1>
 <p>The whole thing was implemented by people who came up with amazing stories that held people&rsquo;s attention and kept their tribe alive! Thye worked, they came alive, and they imposed their own purpose: to preserve its life.</p>

<h1>Religion</h1> 
 <p>There have been many religions with many of these fantastic stories. They have kept us alive. They have sustained us, helped us bear the pain of illness and deaths, and contain the destructive powers of sensuality-as-satan. And they have done so by deciding who shall live and who may die,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Men shall live, woman may die.</li>
   <li>Feudal lords and their families shall live, vassals may die.</li>
   <li>Royalty shall live, common people may die.</li>
   <li>Powerful people shall live, everybody else may die.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Everythig Else May Die</h1>
 <p>I really don&rsquo;t know when religious beliefs and practices turned against us. What we do know is that we are still here (good). We also know that the anthroposphere will collapse and our societies will go with it (not so good).</p>

<h1>Democracy, Dictatorship, and Everying in Between</h1>
 <p>Religion gave way to <em>politics</em>. As the old religion-based systems went off center stage, politics thrived. Who shall live and who may die became more&hellip; fluid.</p>

<h1>No Deification</h1>
 <p>The &ldquo;solution&rdquo; is not the deification of science and technolgy. Science and technology, yes, but their deification, no.</p>

<h1>People</h1>
 <p>Today, people can take it from here.</p>
