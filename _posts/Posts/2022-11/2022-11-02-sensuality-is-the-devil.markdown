 <p>The serpent that tempted Eve to convince Adam to bite the apple. That snake, represents sensuality and life. That effort to eliminate that snake eventuall went counter to the preservation of life.</p>

<h1>Bad for the survival of society</h1>
 <p>But why, oh why, was sensuality depicted as bad for the preservation of life? My guess is as the early societies saw that sensuality lead to the exhaustion of the young people who did the bulk of the work to feed the tribe. It also lead to the deaths of women and oftentimes the child. When things went well, it resulted to more mouths to feed.</li>
 <p>Sensuality had a lot of negatives,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Work loss.</li>
   <li>Potential loss of young people.</li>
   <li>The pain of loss.</li>
   <li>More mouths to feed.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Sensuality was not good for those early society. Sensuality is satan! Several thousand years later, conditions have changed, perhaps &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; to the demonization of sensuality. Today, the threat to life is no longer sensuality. The threat to live is the lack of sensuality and everything that contributed to lack of relationships. The threat to live today is that we are destructing our life support system.</p>

<h1>Renouncing the Snake</h1>
 <p>Because we don&rsquo;t know any different, assume that renouncing the sensuality-as-snake preserved like and improved life a long time ago. However, the scaffolding turned against the very impact we wanted to accomplish. We erected to preserve life, but the scaffolding developed a purpose of its own: to preserve its life.</p>

<h1>The Shaman is the Boss</h1>
 <p>The whole thing was implemented by people who came up with amazing stories that held the attention of their people and kept them and their tribe alive: they worked! And they came live and imposed their owne their purpose, their own <em>why</em>: preserve its life. Of couse, to preserve human live. At least, most lives. The Shaman&rsquo;s life for sure, others&rsquo; were secondary.</p>

<h1>Religion</h1> 
 <p>There have been many religions with many of these fantastic stories that have kept us people alive. They have sustained us, helped us bear the pain of illness and deaths, and contain the destructive powers of sensuality-as-satan. As much as anything else, religions have kept us alive. It has done so by deciding who shall live and who may die,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Men shall live, woman may die.</li>
   <li>Feudal lords and their families shall live, vassals may die.</li>
   <li>Royalty shall live, common people may die.</li>
   <li>Powerful people shall live, everybody else may die.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Everythig Else May Die</h1>
 <p>I really don&rsquo;t know when the religious beliefs and practices turned against us. What we do know is that we are still here (good) and on the minus side, the anthroposphere will collapse and our societies will go with it (not so good).</p>

<h1>Democracy, Dictatorship, and Everying in Between</h1>
 <p>Religion gave way to <em>politics</em> and the purpose of keeping itself alive. And, yes, it helped preserve some peoples&rsquo; lifes. But that a while back. As the old religion-based systems went off center stage, politics thrived. Who shall live and who may die became more&hellip; fluid, a system that works for some, not all.</p>

<h1>Deification: Just Say No!</h1>
 <p>The &ldquo;solution&rdquo; is not the deification of science and technolgy. Science and technology, yes, but their deification, no.</p>
 <p>We have enough world-wide technology that people can take it from here.</p>
