 <p>&ldquo;Just get rid of ownership and everything will be fine.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a recurring and dangerous fantasy. Ownership is actually a good thing, although we have taken it to an extreme.</p>

 Just get rid of ownership and everything will be fine.
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>This fantasy goes on, and on, but it always ends up in the same system of servitude, extraction, and exploitation. Ownership is actually a good thing, although we have taken it to an extreme in our <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world.</p>

<h1>Corporate Ownership is Bad</h1>
 <p>In our <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world corporate ownership has been weaponized: music is exploited for financial gain; even your ideas belong to the company you happen to work for.</p>
 <p>Worse, corporate ownership is fixed, forever.</p>

<h1>Personal Ownership is Good</h1>
 <p>On the other hand, personal ownership<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is a good thing: this is my house, not yours; this is your toothbrush, not mine.</p>
 <p>We (mostly) don’t have to fight over it.</p>

<h1>Fixed Ownership is Bad</h1>
 <p>The worst part of what I am calling corporate ownership is that it is fixed, forever. If you get 30% of the company, that 30% is yours forever. Your relatives can inherit it, for generations, just like Prince Charles became King of Britain after mommy Queen died.</p>

<h1>Dynamic Ownership Is Good</h1>
 <p>The alternative to fixed ownership, based on force, is dynamic ownership, based on contributions.</p>
 <p>Our <em>RADs!</em> application makes it possible to quantify contributions.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Everybody gets the <em>RADs!</em> app.</li>
  <li>We all use the app to recognize contributions as we see them.</li>
  <li>Based on these <em>contributions</em>, the <em>RADs!</em> app calculates <em>how many</em> <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s each person gets.

  </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>The number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s a person has determines the amount of ownership she has.</li>
  <li>The number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s determines, for example, the number of dividends, ownership of assets, or ownership of the brand that each person gets.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Also,</p>
 <ul>
  <li><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are a dimensionless unit of measure (<em>e.g.</em>, not a currency).</li>
  <li>The recognition criteria is completely up to each person. This is what makes a decentralized distribution possible.</li>
  <li>Every person gets the same number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s (<em>i.e.</em>, one per day).</li>
  <li>Recognitions are translated to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>And, also,</p>
 <ul>
  <li><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s represent dynamic ownership. One month I may get a lot of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, but next month I may not get any.</li>
  <li>My percentage ownership goes up and down dynamically. For example,</li>
  <div class="_center">
   <img
    src="/assets/img/rads-fluctuations.svg"
    width="70%"
    alt="">
  </div>
  <li>If you have 200 <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s and I have 100, then you’ll get twice (revenue, assets, etc.) as me.</li>
 </ul>
