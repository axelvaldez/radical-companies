<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>We can’t drive to the future in a gas-powered car. We need a fundamentally different vehicle.</p>

<h1>The <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> World</h1>
 <p>The world is ruled by fiat—&ldquo;because I say so.&rdquo; The <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world we live in has worked in the sense that it has made things better for many of us, but it can never be just.</p>
 <p>Think of it this way: trying to fix the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> model is like trying to get a gas car to consume less gas. You can tweak it, add heated seats, power mirrors, make it more gas efficient, or even make a gas-electric hybrid, but it will <em>always</em> be a gas car. No amount of tweaking will make it anything else. No gas, no work. </p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model is like the all-electric car. It still looks like a car but it has a completely new infrastructure and it is fundamentally different. No gas, no problem.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> anchors us to the past and the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model will take us to the future.</p>

<h1>Based on Extraction</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world is based on extraction,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>My wellbeing is extracted from everybody else&rsquo;s wellbeing (servitude).</li>
  <li>My wellbeing is determined by my (financial) wealth and my wealth is extracted from everybody else’s wealth (enclosure).</li>
  <li>My wealth is grown from everybody else&rsquo;s labor (exploitation).</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The injustice, and horror, that this mindset engenders is actually pretty predictable,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Primitive capitalism maximizes enclosures and exploitation. What used to be for the use of nearby people is now private, for the exclusive use of the brute that forced all others to leave.</li>
  <li>This engenders class struggle and, oftentimes, bloody revolution. All the fighting is for naught and the system remains the same.</li>
  <li>Servitude, enclosure, and exploitation remain.</li>
  <li>At one extreme we have the dictatorships where the leader becomes the new owner of everything after purging out his former collaborators and ownership becomes very, very centralized.</li>
  <li>At the other extreme we have democracies where leaders are elected and ownership becomes more decentralized centralized, but it stays centralized in a few hands.</li>
  <li>Servitude, enclosure, and exploitation continue unabated.</li>
  <li>Modern capitalism loosens up and moves humankind forward, but it remains unjust and exploitative by design.</li>
  <li>Modern capitalism also increases its ability to destroy people&rsquo;s life support system, even for the very people leading this destruction.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>This may be strange, but it is actually rational, given our <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> culture. We need a different culture if we want our anthropocene to survive.</p>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model is an alternative to <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>. It is not a dogma, or a recipe, or a given set of practices or incantations. It describes a foundation that helps keep you aware of where your choices lead. You must then decide what to do.</p>
 <table class="_center">
  <tr>
   <td rowspan="3" style="width:1em; font-size:7pt; ">F O U N D A T I O N</td>
   <th>Principles</th>
   <td>Meaning, Belonging</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Commitments</th>
   <td>Decentralization, Transparency</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Practices</th>
   <td>Explicit Alignment, Experimentation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="_spacer"></td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 <p>You can think of them as ranges,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Will this decision make it more feasible for people to find meaning through what they do or not?</li>
  <li>Will it make us more or less decentralized?</li>
  <li>Will it make it easier or harder to experiment?</li>
 </ul>
 <p>A fundamentally different infrastructure. Simple, though not easy, to live by.</p>

<h1>RADs!</h1>
 <p>Besides a foundation, we need tools to build the future that will nourish us and our life support system. In the same minimalist fashion, we came up with the <em>RADs!</em> application.</p>
