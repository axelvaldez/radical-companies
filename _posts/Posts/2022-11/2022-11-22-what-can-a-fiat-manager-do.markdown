 <p>Since a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> manager can do anything she wants with her team, she can experiment with <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> practices. She can always say they are just a &ldquo;clever&rdquo; <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> technique to lessen her load.</p>

 <p>We talk a lot about starting <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies. This is the easy way out for us, the book&rsquo;s authors,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> because we find starting companies to be straightforward,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Matt quickly adapted to the startup culture in Silicon Valley</li>
   <li>Adrian grew up in it</li>
   <li>Jose has been an entrepreneur since the tender age of 16</li>
  </ul>
 <p>But building a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company from scratch is a hack because most people work in <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses as their only option. So, what can <em>they</em> do? Can they adopt some of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> practices? Can they get away with it?</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> in Small Bites</h1>
 <p>If you are a manager in a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> environment, then implementing some <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> practices can be fairly easy because what you say, goes. You later tell your boss and HR what you want; you can even tell them that it is just a clever <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> trick.</p>

<h1>Bonuses</h1>
 <p>As a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> boss, you’ve seen the reviews, you’ve used HR’s point scale to rank employees. You have gone through the process many times and you know it doesn’t work. You also know that is not satisfying.</p>
 <p>You know that you cannot constantly assess your employees the same way they can track each other. The latest technique from HR is not going to really measure contributions.</p>
 <p>Employees know that you decision is based on who you like as much as anything else, and they compete with each other to bias your affections. That sort of politicking is poisonous to collaboration.</p>
 <p>Instead, you share the RADs! application with your team. They can reward each other for what they see as a contribution. Then you don’t have to sweat it and you base your bonus allocation on the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> distribution. Is this subversive? Yes! But, is it good? Hell, yeah. But just imagine how you and your team will feel by the end of this process.</p>

<h1>Virtual <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span></h1>
 <p>In software, there is the concept of a virtual machine, where you can emulate one computer inside another computer system. For example, you could run the Linux operating system inside MS Windows, or vice versa. The software handles it.</p>
 <p>Similarly, you run <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> inside a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> organization.</p>
 <p>Deploying <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> wherever it can be run, will lead to more adoption. Mistakes will be made. You’ll have to discuss what seems to you like the same topic over and over. Somebody will run to HR to find out their take on this <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> thing and it may tank it before it gets a chance to work. You may even get fired over it.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the arbitrary nature of management actually works in your favor. “I’m in charge of this team, so I can do whatever I want.” You could “clear” with your boss and tell him that you are going to try to offload some of your work onto your employees (suckers). </p>
 <p>Whatever you do, try this and help the adoption of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model. It will be good for you and the world.</p>
