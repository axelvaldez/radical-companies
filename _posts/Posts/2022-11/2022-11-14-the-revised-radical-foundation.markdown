 <p>I have been thinking about the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> foundation and I think that it can be made tighter. Any more that three things, I forget (and many other people, too).</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>I have been thinking about the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> foundation. In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL COMPANIES</span> book we described it as,</p>
  <table align="center">
   <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE; ">
    <th>principles&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
    <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="_spacer"></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>commitments&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
    <td>Transparency & Decentralization</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="_spacer"></td>
   </tr>
   <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE; ">
    <th>practices&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
    <td>Alignment & Experimentation</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="_spacer"></td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 <p>But I have a minimalist bent and would have preferred to have three rather than six things to remember. Any more than three things, I forget. And, from my own experience, many other people, too. For example, on several ocassion I asked individuals if they remembered the company&rsquo;s values (<em>i.e.</em>, we had five), but none of them could come up with more than two or three. Then I asked in small groups and they came up with five, and sometime six, values. The thing is that in order to live those values, you have to remember them and you won&rsquo;t if they are more than three.</p>

<h1>People</h1>
 <p>I am not sure about how to separate Meaning and Belonging.</p>
 <p>Belonging is key because Meaning is something we get primarily from &ldquo;the others&rdquo; in my community. If I make a spear to fish, it becomes significant to myself next time I am hungry and I eat the fish that I caught with my spear. But when I see <em>somebody else</em> make a spear like mine to fish, that is when my expression becomes a contribution!</p>
 <p>But the individual person is <em>central</em> to the <span claa="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model. In fact, an individual can belong to many communities at the same time and each will react to my individual&rsquo;s expression differently, from &ldquo;uh?&rdquo; to &ldquo;CONTRIBUTION!&rdquo;</p>
 <p>I now think that more basic than Meaning and Belonging is People. People as individuals and People in communities.</p>

<h1>Decentralization</h1>
 <p>I now believe that Transparency and Decentralization are redundant. At the completely decentralized end, there will be nobody in charge of keeping secrets and everything will be 100% transparent. On the way there people may consider keeping some things secret, but that person would be a boss of those secrets.</p>
 <p>With partial decentralization, the question would be, &ldquo;Who is going to be the boss? Who is going to be in charge of the area&rsquo;s secrets?&rdquo; Until you have a complete transition, somebody is going to be the boss. Even if this is &ldquo;boss&rdquo; is a small committee with a term limit, so long as there are secrets, there is a boss.</p>

<h1>Experimentation</h1>
 <p>I was never very happy with the combination of Explicit Alignment and Experimentation under Practices. I now think that Experimentation is <em>the</em> <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> practice; Explicit Alignment is a tool&mdash;One that is key and absolutely necessary, but it&rsquo;s just a tool.</p>
