 <p>Ownership is enclosures-as-robbery, a human invention, the foundation of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Ownership is,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The result of enclosures brought about by violent robbery (<em>i.e.</em>, Marxists rejoice).</li>
   <li>The best ever human invention (<em>i.e.</em>, Neoliberals rejoice).</li>
   <li>The foundation of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model (<em>i.e.</em>, everybody is puzzled).</li>
  </ul>
 <p>ownership really is all of those things at once.</p>

<h1>Possession</h1>
 <p>&ldquo;Ownership followed &hellip; possession&rdquo;,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
  <ul>
   <li>Human babies cry and fight to keep their possessions.</li>
   <li>The story goes that &ldquo;when farming came along,&rdquo; possession had to, just had to, be formalized into ownership.</li>
   <li>Just as believable is that once some people figured out how to use laws as a tool, they defined ownership as legit. &ldquo;This land is mine! See? It says it right here in the law book (which I just wrote).&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>
 <p>This process of legitimizing enclosures is still going on, although these days is more about <em>forever copyrigts</em>, <em>never-ending patents</em>, and <em>data</em>.</p>

<h1>MINE! MINE!</h1>
 <p>Anything a toddler comes in contact with is &ldquo;MINE!&rdquo; At least, for a little while. It probably has to do with the fact that,
  <ul>
   <li>Anything and everything we come in contact with, and doesn&rsquo;t harm us, can, according to our brains,<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">2&nbsp;</sup></a> extend our bodies. It all happens easily and swiftly (<em>i.e.</em>, unconciously).</li>
   <li>And, of course, anything that is part of our body cannot be let go just like that.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>It all goes to say that possession is a very real, intrinsic thing and we should not pretend otherwise. We tried believing that &ldquo;from the glorious revolution a new man would rise&rdquo; who would not be attached to possessions, but that&rsquo;s not the way it went. Not at all.</p>
 <p>What about the farming-led-to-ownership story? Well, let&rsquo;s just say that that it is just a story, and not very convincing. In any case, none us were there and we are all guessing. These days, it makes more sense to me that the whole possession-to-ownership thing had more to do with the invention of coinage,<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">3&nbsp;</sup></a> another grand human invention.</p>

<h1>Going Forward</h1>
 <p>The thing what happened in the past cannot be fixes. I am more interested in what we do <em>going forward</em>.</p>
 <p>We have to make things better for everybody, not a just a subset of humanity. If ownership is a good thing, then let&rsquo;s extend it and make it work for everybody. We can do it in a steady-eddy, gradual way, without violence.</p>
 <p>And that is what <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> Distributions are about: A tool for revolutionaries, without the explosives.</p>

<h1>For More,</h1>
