 <p>Ownership is enclosures-as-robbery, a human invention, and the foundation of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Ownership is,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The result of enclosures brought about by violent robbery (<em>i.e.</em>, Marxists rejoice).</li>
   <li>The best ever human invention (<em>i.e.</em>, Neoliberals rejoice).</li>
   <li>The foundation of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model (<em>i.e.</em>, everybody is puzzled).</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Ownership really is all of those things at once.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <div class="_quotation">
  I have, therefore I am. And the more I have, the more I am.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 </div>
 <p>In a conversation today we were wondering about “ownership.” Since then, we’ve been researching it messier than not.</p>

<h1>Capitalism</h1>
 <p>According to the book <em>The Economy</em>,<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">2&nbsp;</sup></a> capitalism consists of three institutions. From oldest to most recent, they are,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>private property</li>
  <li>markets</li>
  <li>capitalization</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Private property, (<em>i.e.</em>, ownership), then, is the oldest of the three.</p>

<h1>Ownership</h1>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Ownership is the state or fact of legal possession and control over property&hellip;</span><a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">3&nbsp;</sup></a><p>
 <p>And it is not just a personal thing,</p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Ownership refers to the legal right of an individual, group, corporation or government to the possession of a thing.</span><a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">4&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Possession means physical control over a property.</span><a href="#en05"><sup id="bm05">5&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">“Property is a system of rights that gives people legal control of valuable things, and also refers to the valuable things themselves.</span><a href="#en06"><sup id="bm06">6&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>So &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; is &ldquo;possession,&rdquo; a physical thing, over &ldquo;property,&rdquo; a legal thing.</p>

<h1>Fun Facts</h1>
 <p>From the Science of Ownership, they list these among <em>Fun Facts about Ownership</em>,<a href="#en07"><sup id="bm07">7&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 <ul>
  <li>Control is a key central concept and inseparable when discussing the concept of ownership.</li>
  <li>Ownership may be experienced individually or collectively</li>
  <li>Awareness of ownership rights already emerges in children as young as 2 or 3 years.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>This last one is nonsense: our brains come wired for attachment, a form of  possession, but that has little to do with ownership.</p>

<h1>Social Skills</h1>
 <p class="_quotespan">As children get older, they gain social skills and learn to negotiate the conflicts on their own.<a href="#fn8"><sup id="bm08">8&nbsp</a></sup></p>
 <p>The same goes for adults: as we get further and further away from the FIAT regime, we will need to “gain social skills” to be a co-owner working with other co-owners.</p>

<h1>Equity Ownership</h1>
 <p class="_quotespan">We do not consider equitable ownership as true ownership because it is only <em>the benefit</em> of the property that the buyer will use and enjoy.<a href="#en09"><sup id="bm09">9;</sup></a></p>

<h1>Utility</h1>
 <p>The difference between psychological experience and utility (<em>i.e.</em>, hard value) is not linear: 10 is the same experience to someone who has 10 thousand, as 100 is to someone with 100 thousand.</p>
 <p class="_quotespan">People&rsquo;s choices are based not on dollar values, but on the psychological values of outcomes, their utilities.<a href="#en10"><sup id="bm10">10</sup></a></p>

<h1>Possession</h1>
 <p>&ldquo;Ownership followed &hellip; possession&rdquo;,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
  <ul>
   <li>Human babies cry and fight to keep their possessions.</li>
   <li>The story goes that &ldquo;when farming came along,&rdquo; possession had to, just had to, be formalized into ownership.</li>
   <li>Just as believable is that once some people figured out how to use laws as a tool, they defined ownership as legit. &ldquo;This land is mine! See? It says it right here in the law book (which I just wrote).&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>
 <p>This process of legitimizing enclosures is still going on, although these days is more about <em>forever copyrigts</em>, <em>never-ending patents</em>, and <em>data</em>.</p>

<h1>MINE! MINE!</h1>
 <p>Anything a toddler comes in contact with is &ldquo;MINE!&rdquo; At least, for a little while. It probably has to do with the fact that,
  <ul>
   <li>Anything and everything we come in contact with, and doesn&rsquo;t harm us, can, according to our brains,<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">2&nbsp;</sup></a> extend our bodies. It all happens easily and swiftly (<em>i.e.</em>, unconciously).</li>
   <li>And, of course, anything that is part of our body cannot be let go just like that.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>It all goes to say that possession is a very real, intrinsic thing and we should not pretend otherwise. We tried believing that &ldquo;from the glorious revolution a new man would rise&rdquo; who would not be attached to possessions, but that&rsquo;s not the way it went. Not at all.</p>
 <p>What about the farming-led-to-ownership story? Well, let&rsquo;s just say that that it is just a story, and not very convincing. In any case, none us were there and we are all guessing. These days, it makes more sense to me that the whole possession-to-ownership thing had more to do with the invention of coinage,<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">3&nbsp;</sup></a> another grand human invention.</p>

<h1>Going Forward</h1>
 <p>What happened in the past cannot be fixed. What counts is what we do <em>going forward</em>.</p>
 <p>We have to make things better for everybody, not a just a subset of humanity. If ownership is a good thing, then let&rsquo;s extend it and make it work for everybody. We can do it in a steady-eddy, gradual way, without violence.</p>
 <p>And <em>that</em> is what <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> Distributions are about: A tool for revolutionaries, without the explosives. See,</p>
