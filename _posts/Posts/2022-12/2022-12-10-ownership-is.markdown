 <p>Ownership is enclosures-as-robbery, a human invention, the foundation of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Ownership is,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The result of enclosures brought about by violent robbery (<em>i.e.</em>, Marxists rejoice).</li>
   <li>The best ever human invention (<em>i.e.</em>, Neoliberals rejoice).</li>
   <li>The foundation of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model (<em>i.e.</em>, everybody is puzzled).</li>
  </ul>
 <p>ownership really is all of those things at once.</p>

<h1>Possession</h1>
 <p>Before legal ownership, there was possession.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Human babies cry and fight to keep their possessions.</li>
   <li>The story goes that &ldquo;when farming came along,&rdquo; possession had to, just had to, be formalized into ownership.</li>
   <li>Just as believable is that once some people figured out how to use laws as a tool, they defined ownership as legit. &ldquo;This land is mine! See? It says it right here in the law book (which I just wrote).&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>
 <p>This process of legitimizing enclosures (legal robbery>=?) is still with us, although these days is more about <em>forever copyrigts</em>, <em>never-ending patents</em>, <em>private servers</em>, and <em>data</em>.</p>

<h1>MINE! MINE!</h1>
 <p>Anything a toddler comes in contact with is &ldquo;MINE!&rdquo; At least, for a little while. It probably has to do with the fact that,
  <ul>
   <li>According to our brains anything and everything we come in contact with, and doesn&rsquo;t harm us, can extend our bodies. It all happens easily and swiftly (<em>i.e.</em>, unconciously).</li>
   <li>And, of course, anything that is part of our body cannot be let go just like that.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>No matter, possession is a very real and very personal thing and we should not pretend otherwise. We tried believing that &ldquo;from the glorious revolution a new man would rise&rdquo; who&rsquo;d be less attached to possessions, but that&rsquo;s not the way it went. At all.</p>
 <p>What about the farming-led-to-ownership story? Well, let&rsquo;s just say that that it is just a story. And I don&rsquo;t find it very convincing. In any case, none us were there and one guess is as good as another. These days, it makes more sense to me that the whole possession-to-ownership thing had more to do with coinage,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> another human invention.</p>

<h1>Going Forward</h1>
 <p>The thing is that I am not very interested in fixing what happened in the past. I am more interested in what we do going forward. And going forward we have to make things better for everybody, not a just a subset of humanity. And I believe that what&rsquo;s good for the goose&hellip;. If ownership is good for the few, let&rsquo;s do it for everybdody. Let&rsquo;s set up a mechanism to spreads ownership to everybody. Not in a sudden, violent way, but in a steady-eddy, sustainable kind of way. And that&rsquo;s what the <span class="_paradigm">RAD Distribution</span> is about.</p>
