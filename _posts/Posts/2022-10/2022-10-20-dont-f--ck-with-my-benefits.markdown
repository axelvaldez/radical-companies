 <p>RADs are OK, but what about my benefits (e.g., vacations, parental time off, sick days)? I am going to put that at risk?</pre>
</p>
</div>

<h1>FIAT Benefits</h1>
 <p>Vacations, parental time off, and sick days are some of the FIAT benefits that people throw up as an objection to the RADICAL model.</p>
 <p>The RADs system is sold as all goodness, but there has to be a downside to them.</p>
 <table>

   <th colspan="2" >RADICAL Goodness</th>

  <tr>
   <th>Bonus</th>
   <td>
    Replaced by <em>earned dividends</em>, which are calculated based on the number of RADs. They, in turn, are calculated based on the number of recognized contributions your peers have given you.</th>
    <br>
    Keep in mind that the RADs you have  with previous companies are still generating income.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Salaryf</th>
   <td>As your company matures and people are more experienced with RAD distributions, salaries can be replaced with a <em>predictable recurring income</em> (PRI) system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="_spacer"></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
   <th colspan="2" >RADICAL Difference</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Vacation</th>
   <td rowspan="4" >
    You determine how much time off you want to take. Since the <em>earned dividends</em> are going directly to you, you get to “pay” for any time you take that’s not generating income.
    <br>
    Keep in mind that the RADs you have  with previous companies are still generating income.

  <tr>
   <th>Parental Time Off</th>

 <p>You can also create BANNERs for all these eventualities. These can be individual BANNERs, company-wide, or anywhere in between. For example, some of your peers may agree to reserve 10% of their income for “benefits,” </p>
 <div class="_center">

   width="70%"

 </div>
 <p>But you want to put away 20%,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/icon-dont-f--ck-with-my-benefits-02.svg"
   width="70%"
   alt="">
 </div>
 <p>Later, the whole company learns from your experiments and everybody, including you, decide to put away 15%,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/icon-dont-f--ck-with-my-benefits-03.svg"
   width="70%"
   alt="">
 </div>
 <p>Very likely, you will figure out that this “benefit” thing is born of a nostalgic fear from living for so long in a FIAT environment. You decide to not “put away” anything because your RADs can take care of all of it and then some.</p>
