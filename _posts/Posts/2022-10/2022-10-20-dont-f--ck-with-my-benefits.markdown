<div style="display:none;">
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are OK, but what about my benefits (e.g., vacations, parental time off, sick days)? I don&rsquo;t want to put that at risk!</p>
</div>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> Benefits</h1>
 <p>&ldquo;<span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s sount like it&rsquo;s going to let businesses bypass their responsibilities and put my benefits at risk&rdquo;.</p>
 <p>Vacations, parental time off, and sick days are some of the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> benefits that people throw up as an objection to the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model. The <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s system is sold as all goodness, but there has to be a downside to them, right?</p>
 
 <h1>The RADICAL Difference</h1>
  <p>The RADICAL model is not about tweaing the system we live in. It is very different. It seem threatening. &ldquo;The current system is all I know. It has been built over hundreds of years and it has made out lives better, right? Why change it so drastically? What is dramatically wrong with it that you want to pull it apart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Actually, things will not be that different. Our lives will keep improving, but without the exploitation of other people. For me to be &ldquo;rich&rdquo; you don't have to be &ldquo;poor.&rdquo; For my live to be better, we don't have to break Earth. For us to feel better, we don't have to make other feel miserable.</p>
  Perhaps our job is to create the conditions for things to get better, not to predict that they won’t.

    You determine how much long you want to be inactive (<em>i.e.</em>, how much time off you want to take). Since the <em>earned dividends</em> are going directly to you, you get to &ldquo;pay&rdquo; for any time you take that&rsquo;s not generating income.

<h1><span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>s</h1>
 <p>You can also create <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>s for these eventualities. These can be individual <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>s, company-wide, or anywhere in between. For example, some of your peers may agree to reserve 10% of their income for &ldquo;benefits,&rdquo; </p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/icon-dont-f--ck-with-my-benefits-01.svg"
   width="50%"
   alt="A yellow post-it note with the word BENEFITS at the top, a hand-drawn line, and a list of beneficiaris, five in total.">
 </div>
 <p>But you want to put away 20%,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/icon-dont-f--ck-with-my-benefits-02.svg"
   width="50%"
   alt="A yellow post-it note with the word BENEFITS at the top, a hand-drawn line, followed by '@you.'">
 </div>
 <p>Later, the whole company learns from your experiments and everybody, including you, decide to put away 15%,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/icon-dont-f--ck-with-my-benefits-03.svg"
   width="50%"
   alt="A yellow post-it note with the word BENEFITS at the top, a hand-drawn line, followed by '@all.'">
 </div>
 <p>After a while, you will figure out that this &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; thing is born of a nostalgic fear from living for so long in a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> environment. You decide to not &ldquo;put away&rdquo; anything because your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s can take care of all of it and then some.</p>

<h1>Retirement</h1>
 <p>&ldquo;Retirement&rdquo; is yet another <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; that is handled very differently in the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>For example, your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s may be your &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; fund. This would work if the revenues of all the companies you have co-owned are generally going up compared to the number of co-owners.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, a company that you are part of may decide to reserve a percentage of its <em>earned dividends</em> to pay <em>inactive</em> co-owners.</li>
  <li>Another company may treat it as an <em>expense</em> and take it off the top before calculating its <em>earned dividends</em>.</li>
  <li>Yet another may decide that once your income falls to a certain level, they&rsquo;ll make up the difference out of income (<em>i.e.</em>, similar to a PRI fund).</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Why the Quotation Marks?</h1>
 <p>I have consistently put quotation marks around the word &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; because they are <em>not</em> benefits. At least, they are not a benefit to you as much as they are a benefit to businesses. Over years, centuries, we have been tweaking the pay system to accommodate people&rsquo;s needs. As Chuck Blakeman remind us,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> it starts at zero pay during slavery to higher pay now, but still with a lot of proverty. The &ldquo;signal&rdquo; to pay more usually comes as some form of violence: strikes, revolution, or war.</p>
 <p>Eventually, governments impose taxes and benefits to calm things down. This imposition is a form of violence, but businesses go along with it because they know it is better for them than the more violent alternative.</p>
 <p>As a result, we have ended up with a hodgepodge of &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; worldwide. Primarily because of lack of trust, of the business owners and the workers, the money for these benefits goes up to governments. Then a bureaucracy develops to &ldquo;manage&rdquo; this money &ldquo;on behalf of&rdquo; the workers.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model assumes that people know their needs better than any government, as benevolent as it may be. It follows, then, that people are the best &ldquo;managers&rdquo; of what they need to live. In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model money in the form of <em>earned dividends</em> go directly to each of us. And, yes, we all have to learn a lot. For example, sometimes it is better to deal with things by oneself and sometimes it is better to team up with others. We&rsquo;ll have to learn that.</p>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s just say that the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model applies to learning, too.</p>
