<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investments are more like an Angel investment or a real estate investment. Actually, it could be both. For sure, they are not at all like Venture Capital investments.</p>
 <p>Here is a sketch of each&hellip;</p>
 
<h1>Venture Capital Investments</h1>
 <p>A Venture Capital (VC) investment triggers an ownership transfer. The business now has to issue shares of stock so they can give a &ldquo;forever&rdquo; percentage of stock to the VC investor in exchange for their capital. VC investors also expect a seat on the Board to have control over the business.</p>
 <p>In my experience, they contribute almost nothing to the success of the business other than their capital. Their advice is hard to come by and, in fairness, they don't have the bandwidth to give you more than casual attention.</p>
 
<h1>Angel Investments</h1>
 <p>An Angel investment does not trigger an ownership transfer.</p>
 <p>Angel investors exchange their capital in for a promisory note. The note usuall spells out the maximum return that Angels could expect. There are no stocks and they do not get a seat on the Board.</p>
 <p>Besides their capital, their advice is also very valuable as they can help with raising capital, give business and industry advice, etc. Sometime you get to your investor, but oftentimes they are off to the next investment. When they offer a contribution, they are doing it 1) out of kindness and 2) to improve the chances of success of their invesment.</p>

<h1>Real Estate Investments</h1>
 <p>A real estate investment does not trigger an ownership transfer, either.</p>
 <p>Real estate investors exchange their capital for an annuity. They receive their return as a percentage of their investment on a recurring basis. Normally, this return goes on for the life of the investor, but it may also survive the death of the original investor.</p>
 <p>BTW, I am not sure if this applies to <em>all</em> types of real estate investments, but it applies to hotels and other real estate ventures.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Investments</h1>
 <p>A <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investment does not trigger an ownership transfer, either. <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investors do not seek control of the companies they invest in, nor are they looking for a &ldquo;forever&rdquo; return.</p>
 <p>Like the Angel investment, a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Investments exchanges capital for a promisory note. Like a real estate investment, the return may come as an annuity.</p>
 <p>Of not, is that a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investor can also participate in the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> distribution by making contributions.</p>
 <p>That industry advice and early customers introductions are contributions and would probably be recognized as such. These recognitions would translate into <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> and they in turn translate into <em>earned dividends</em>. This is probably the most attractive feature of <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investments for investors.</p>
