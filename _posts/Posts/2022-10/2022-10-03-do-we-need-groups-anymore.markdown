<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>I am starting to wonder whether we need groups at all anymore. What if <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> income just came from personal rather than corporate income? I am also really tempted to start calling groups of <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> people Conviviums, a word that I got from one of the CasP papers.</p>
 <p>So I&rsquo;m going to try and flesh out this idea of payment. Let&rsquo;s say, I think of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s as being able to reward the giants on whose shoulders I have stood and the people I am in community with. And solely that.</p>

<h1>YouTube, Patreon, and Discord</h1>
 <p>For example, I have a YouTube channel where I published DIY videos related to my 3D Printing projects. I also have a Patreon account. And I start a Discord chat that centers around my inventing activities&mdash;everyone my Patreon sponsors gets to be in the chat.</p>
 <p>Altogether, I generate revenue from,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>YouTube Ads</li>
  <li>Patreon sponsorhips</li>
 </ul>
 <p>I invite everyone who provides YouTube feedback to a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community. Also, I invite to that community Patreon sponsors that provide value in the form of feedback about my videos. That inspires me as well and I want to reward them. So I invite them to my <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community, recognize their contributions, and they get <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. Everyone with <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s shares my dividents from the YouTube revenue. Maybe not all of it, but, say, half of it.</p>

 <p>Let&rsquo;s say I make $5K and I distribute $2.5K of it through the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s according to the allocations (<em>i.e.</em>, which everyone can see). The actual money can be distributed through Venmo, CashApp, or Zelle.</p>
 <p>Perhaps I only want to share the YouTube dividends and not the Patreon dividends. In this case, I&rsquo;ll create a <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span> for the <em>YouTube</em> revenue,</p>
 <div class="_center">

 </div>
 <p>I could do the same with my Patreon revenue or any of the other revenue streams that may come up later.</p>

<h1>Always Fuzzy</h1>
 <p>Suppose that someone says, &ldquo;You look so confident and attractive,&rdquo; in response to one of my YouTube videos. Should I give them &ldquo;YouTube Community&rdquo; <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s?</p>
 <p>That night, riding high on the compliment, my partner and I make beautiful love and we make that night all the sweeter. Or feeling inspired by the compliment, I come up with an invention, patent it, and I become a billionaire. Shouldn&rsquo;t the complimenter get to share in my windfall, not just the YouTube <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s?</p>
 <p>We don&rsquo;t know the answer. It is not at all clear. We don&rsquo;t claim that we can cleanse ourselves from the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> midselt and become <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> cherubs overnight. We simply want to start to move away from <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> while we figure out the finer details along the way. But beware that the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> mindset is inside of us, we have been colonized by it, and it will take us all a long time to shake off those habits.</p>

<h1>Convivium Pumps</h1>
 <p>A group of people gets together and they make pumps. One guy makes the impeller. One woman makes the housings. And a nonbinary person sells the pumps.</p>
 <p>A <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> company is happy with the pumps and buys the pumps. Finally, the dividens from the revenue are distributed according to the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s each co-owner has.</p>
