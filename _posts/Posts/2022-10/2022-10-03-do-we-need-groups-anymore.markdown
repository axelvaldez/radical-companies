<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>I am starting to wonder whether we need groups at all anymore. What if <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> income just came from personal rather than corporate income? I am also really tempted to start calling groups of <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> people Conviviums, a word that I got from one of the <em>Capital as Power</em> papers.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>So I&rsquo;m going to try and flesh out this idea of payment. I think of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s as being able to reward the giants on whose shoulders I have stood and the people I am in community with. And solely that.</p>

<h1>Ads and Sponsorships</h1>
 <p>For example, I have a YouTube channel where I published videos of my 3D Printing projects. I also have a Patreon account. And I start a Discord chat that centers around my inventing activities. All my Patreon sponsors get invited to the chat.</p>
 <p>Altogether, I generate revenue from,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>YouTube Ads</li>
  <li>Patreon sponsorhips</li>
 </ul>
 <p>I invite everyone who provides YouTube feedback to a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community and I also invite Patreon sponsors who provide valuable feedback about my videos. Their contributions inspire me and I want to reward them. Everyone in the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community are recognized, by me and everyone else, for their contributions. As a result, they get <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. And everyone with <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s shares the dividents from the YouTube revenue.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">2&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s say I make $5K in dividends and I distribute $2.5K of it through the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> Community according to the allocations (<em>i.e.</em>, which everyone can see). The actual money can be distributed through Venmo, CashApp, or Zelle.</p>
 <p>Note that I am sharing my YouTube dividends. bit not the Patreon dividends. I could do the same any of the other revenue streams that may come up later.</p>

<h1>Confidential and Attrative</h1>
 <p>Suppose that someone says, &ldquo;You look so confident and attractive,&rdquo; in response to one of my YouTube videos. That night, riding high on the compliment, my partner and I make beautiful love and we make that night all the sweeter. Feeling inspired by the compliment and the love making, I come up with an invention, patent it, and I become a billionaire. Shouldn&rsquo;t the complimenter get to share in my windfall? She would if I had recognized her contribution and had given her <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s in an <em>Invention <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community</em></p>
 <p>There is no &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answer, it is not at all clear. We don&rsquo;t claim that we can cleanse ourselves from the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> midselt and become <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> cherubs overnight. But the question helps us to start to move away from the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> mindset. while we figure out the finer details along the way. But beware that we have been colonized by the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> mindset and it will take us all a long time to shake off those habits.</p>
 <p>It seems that in this case,
  <ul>
   <li>I share some of my revenue with the group because they are actively contributing to what I do in YouTube</li>
   <li>On the other hand, I am not sharing my Patreon income because it feels that that comes as a result of my invidual efforts (<em>i.e.</em>, to be revisted later).</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Convivium<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">3</sup></a> Pumps</h1>
 <p>A group of people gets together and they make pumps. One guy makes the impeller. One woman makes the housings. And a nonbinary person sells the pumps.</p>
 <p>A <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> company is happy with the pumps and pays for them. Finally, the dividens from the revenue are distributed according to the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s each co-owner has.</p>
 <p>In this case, the revenue happens because of the work we all do. I could not build pumps at the same rate (and quality) by myself</p>

<h1>In Conclusion&hellip;</h1>
 <p>It seems that even individual results are based on the work of communities. It seems, them, that we need groups, after all.</p>
