 <p><span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>s can be thought of as financial instruments, in particular  an investment agreement.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world we live in, an investment agreement is a legal document that specifies a return or ownership of a collateral. In the tech space, this collateral is most often a piece of the business that&rsquo;s taking the investment. What this means is an investment is made based on the future value of the business-as-collateral. The business may be worth nothing now, but it may be worth of lot in the future (<em>e.g.</em>, the proverbial example is Andy Becholsheim&rsquo;s early investment in Google. a gamble that paid off very well). Accumulated capital funds a future business.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>s can be the equivalent arrangement, except that the future value of an existing company funds a future company. The future value of an existing company is used instead of accumulated capital.</p>
 <p>In the book <em>RADICAL COMPANIES: Without Bosses or Employees</em>, we used the example of investing in a building (not the most fortuitous example, given what&rsquo;s happened office buildings after the COVID-19 pandemic). After some discussion, a <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span> goes up,</p>
  <div class="_center">

 <p>Some, not all, co-owners support it by contributing some of their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to it and in 26 months the fund reaches $5M. This is what happened,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The committed existing co-owners figured how many <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s they needed to contribute every month.</li>
  <li>They didn&rsquo;t account for new co-owners joining the <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>.</li>
  <li>They also didn&rsquo;t (dare to) account for the revenue growth that happened.</li>
  <li>The fund reached its financial goal almost a year sooner than anticipated.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>This allows any co-owner to invest their future value growth. Others won&rsquo;t and some can&rsquo;t. New co-owners may join the BANNER right away, others will wait a while, and still others will sit it out. They can use BANNERs to fund new companies or any other investment.</p>
 <p>In the end, ownership of the building is calculated as the percentage of contribution into the <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>. And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s only, it is up to whatever contributing co-owners decide. If allowed, a wealthier co-owner may decide to contribute her accumulated capital into the <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span> to increase her ownership of the building, or company, or whate have you.</p>
