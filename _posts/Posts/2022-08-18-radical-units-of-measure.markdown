 <p>We need a recognition unit of measure in additons to RADs.</p>
</div>

<h1>Units of Measure</h1>
 <p>In our book, <em><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL COMPANIES</span></em><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> we came up with <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s as a unit of <em>distribution</em>. It turns out that what we also need is a unit of <em>recognition</em>.</p>

<h1>A Unit of Distribution</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s account for the unaccountable as they quantify contributions as recognized by co-owners. <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are not at all conneced to hours or title or any such.</p>
 <p>At distribution time the percentage of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s you have factors the amount of, say, Earned Dividends<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">2&nbsp;</sup></a> you get.</p>
 <p>As we tried to use <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s in the <em>RADs! app</em>, it got too clumsy and cumbersome. Users would end up adding and subtracting: exactly what we didn&rsquo;t want. We wanted to capture the <em>intensity of feeling</em> that the contribution brought up in a co-owner.</p>
 
<h1>A Unit of Recognition</h1>
 <p>To make the process, and the app, easier to use, we needed a unit of recognition, even if they worked completely in the background.</p>
 <p>The <em>RADs! app</em> now lets a co-owner press a recognition button as many times as she feels like it (<em>i.e.</em>, really, there's no limit). This captures the <em>intensity of the feeling</em> that the contribution brought up in the giving co-owner. Let&rsquo;s call her Deb.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom:0; ">At the end of the cycle, the recognitions that Deb gave other co-owners convert to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s,
  <ul>
   <li>The number of recognitions Deb gave each co-owner is divided by the total she gave during the period.</li>
   <li>Each resulting percentage is then multiplied by the total number of days in the cycle.</li>
   <li>This results in the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s other co-owners get from Deb.</li>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <div style="text-align:center; ">

   alt="This is a formula. Its input is 'feelings about contributions.' In the middle, the number of recognitions per co-owner divided by the total number of recognitions given during the cycle. This is then multiplied by the number of days in the cycle. The result is the number of RADs each co-owner gets.">
