 <p>It keeps coming up: how can I talk about <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> to people who don’t know anything about it. What are its Principles, its structure?<sup id="bm01"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
 <p>I don’t know about “principles,” but you have tools that you can talk about,</p>
 <ol>
  <li>The RADs!<sup id="bm02"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> mobile app</li>
  <li>The Agreements<sup id="bm03"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>Its Foundation template</li>
 <p>You can read about the first two in previous posts. So, let’s talk about the Foundation template.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Foundation Template</h1>
 <p>Our deepest problems are the inescapable side-effects of the system we live in, a system based on domination. Our collapsing climate, the expanding wealth gap, discrimation against people of color, the exploitation of women. Instead, we need a generative way of relating to one another, a different paradigm. As we see it, businesses are the place to start. Businesses-as-dictatorship are the root of the problem, so they must be the incubators for what comes next.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model, a <em>company</em> is simply a group of people who come together to build something bigger than themselves. The word "company" comes from the Latin prefix con-, meaning together, and pan, meaning bread. A company then is a group of people who work and socialize together.</p>
 <p>Every company is different because the people who embody it are different. What fundamentally makes a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company different from a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business is that it starts from this simple Foundation.</p>

 <p>From the bottom up,</p>
 <table>
  <tr>
   <th>Experimentation</th>
   <td>
    <p>Means never having to say you’re sorry. But you must tell what you’ve learned from the experiment. If you don’t, nobody, including you, can learn from it. Even saying, “I don’t know why it went wrong” means we learned something from it.</p>
    <p>BTW, whether you do this out loud or written or what have you, it’s something that you all need to agree on from the outset.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Alignment</th>
   <td>
    <p>This is not about everybody doing the goose step the exact same number of inches high. This is a practice 1) to discuss what we want to do together and then 2) making it explicit for all to see.</p>
    <p>This is a good mnemonic for all the elements of a complete alignment. You don’t need all the pieces to get going, but you need to address these questions at some point.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>
    <p>Decentralization</p>
   </th>
   <td>
    <p>This is not absolute: you can move towards Decentralization or away from it. Just be transparent to yourself and others about what you are doing.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>
    <p>Transparency</p>
   </th>
   <td>
    <p>This is not absolute, either: you can move towards Transparency or away from it.</p>
    <p>Note that transparency goes both way: form the group to the individual and from the individual to the group (<em>aka</em>, vulnerability)</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>
    <p>Belonging</p>
   </th>
   <td>
     <p>This is about people. Do you want to work with this group? Does it feel right to be part of this project? Do I agree with their expressed alignment?</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>
    <p>Meaning</p>
   </th>
   <td>
    <p>Can I find meaning in what we are doing together? Do I trust these people to help me find meaning in the work?</p>
