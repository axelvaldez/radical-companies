 <p>I think we know what the rHatchery is: We want to help <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses transform into <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies; businesses that want to get away from the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> path and become healthy companies.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>I think we are getting a better idea of what the rHatchery is: We want to help <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses transform into <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies. We want to engage with businesses that want to get away from the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> path and become healthy companies.</p>
 <p>We came up with many different ways of doing it until we figured out that, first, the rHatchery had to eat its own dog food.</p>

<h1>Trust Agreements</h1>
 <p>Jose came up with a tool we call a Trust Agreement.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> Each would-be co-owner answers these questions for herself and the others takes note. Then, they come up with a narrative that touches on all these topics.</p>

 <p>It surprised us how well this worked to bring out the concerns of the people involved: people laid all kinds of things about themselves that made them volnerable because they felt phychologically safe. So far, we've done it with early adopters, so we don't have the full picture, yet, but what we do have is very reassuring. One the comments we heard is that many organizations never get to this level of trust, even after several years of operations.</p>
 
 <h1>Foundational Agreements</h1>
  <p>The Trust Framwork works for people, but not for communities. For them, the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL FOUNDATIONS</span> may be more appropriate for a Foundational Agreement,</p>
