 <p>It keeps coming up: how can I talk about <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> to people who don’t know anything about it. What are its Principles? What is its structure?</p>
 <p>The thing is that &ldquo;principles&rdquo; and &ldquo;structure&rdquo; are a reflection of <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> concerns. The questions really are about centralized forces. &ldquo;We must have a boss to hold this together.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, you can address these types of questions by talking about the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> tools you do have,</p>

  <li>The Agreements<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">2&nbsp;</sup></a></li>
  <li>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Foundation template</li>
 </ol>
 <p>You can read about the first two in previous posts. This post is about the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Foundation template.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Foundation Template</h1>
 <p>Our deepest problems are the inescapable side-effects of the system we live in: our collapsing climate, the expanding wealth, and wellbeing, gap, discrimation against people of color, the exploitation of women. Instead, we need a generative way of relating to one another, a different paradigm. As we see it, businesses are the place to start. Businesses-as-dictatorship are the root of the problem, so they must be the incubators for what comes next.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model, a <em>company</em> is simply a group of people who come together to build something bigger than themselves. The word "company" comes from the Latin prefix con-, meaning together, and pan, meaning bread. A company then is a group of people who work and socialize together.</p>
 <p>Every company is different because the people who embody it are different. What fundamentally makes a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company different from a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business is that it starts from this simple Foundation.</p>

   <th>Experimentation</th>
   <td>
    <p>Means never having to say you’re sorry. But you must tell what you’ve learned from the experiment. If you don’t, nobody, including you, can learn from it. Even saying, &ldquo;I don’t know why it went wrong&rdquo; means we learned something from it.</p>
    <p>BTW, whether you do this out loud or written or what have you, it’s something that you all need to agree on from the outset.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Alignment</th>
   <td>
    <p>This is not about everybody doing the goose step the exact same number of inches high. This is a practice 1) to discuss what we want to do together and then 2) making it explicit for all to see.</p>
    <p>This is a good mnemonic for all the elements of a complete alignment. You don’t need all the pieces to get going, but you need to address these questions at some point.</p>
