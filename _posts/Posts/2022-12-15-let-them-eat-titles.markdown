<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The transition to <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> from <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> will not happen in a day. It’s going to take time.</p>
 <p>In the meantime, people need to be able to tell what their title is. Some people have the confidence to just choose their own title, but others do not. So how do you assign titles in a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> environment, if you choose to go that route?</p>

<h1>Gore & Associates</h1>
 <p>Some companies, like Gore Associates, the makers of <em>Gore Tex</em> fabrics, just use Associate for everyone. Your coworkers are the people you literally associate with and it makes sense that Associate is a universal title in that environment. When a person at Gore needed to speak to someone outside the organization, they would just write a title down on a business card, so that a person from the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world could easily talk to them.</p>

<h1>Nearsoft</h1>
 <p>I am reminded of a developer at Nearsoft who really wanted somebody to give him a title. Nearsoft didn’t have a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy, so they left it to everyone to give themselves their own title. But this person was looking around the organization hoping to get a title passed down to them. My father told him to just pick his own title, but this guy insisted that he needed to be <em>given</em> one.</p>

<h1>A Social Need</h1>
 <p>Sure we can be the stewards of our identity, but we can not ignore that identity is also provided by our community. If someone is a baker, people know them as such. That part I have no beef with. It’s when people create rigid hierarchies that ignore the individual, reduce them to a number on an expense sheet.</p>
 <p>In a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world identity comes down from above. Your boss, backed up by HR, recognizes your given name and number and dons you a title. This doesn’t work for a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> environment. To me, however, there is something a little <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> about saying that everyone is just an Associate or has no title. It is an attempt to be egalitarian, but implemented in a somewhat <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> way: everybody is an Associate because Bill Gore said so back in 1953.</p>

<h1>Decentralized Ways</h1>
 <p>To decentralize, disentangle. In this case, how do we disentangle the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; functions and decentralize the power of assigning titles? One approach is to have everyone responsible for coming up with their own title, like they did at Nearsoft.</p>
 <p>Another way would be to have everyone who cares assign you a title. After everyone has put in their two cents, you will find you have multiple titles. For example,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>If you are a developer, you might find that most people just call you a <em>Developer</em>.</li>
  <li>Others who have had you as a mentor may call you a <em>Senior Software Engineer</em>.</li>
  <li>The rest may call you an Engineer.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>At the end you are a person with many titles representing the many conceptions that your peers have of you.</p>
 <p>This could happen once a year, or every six months. You might find that people identify you differently over time.</p>
 <p>If you really wanted that &ldquo;Senior&rdquo; part added to your title, then you would have to earn it with your community, and not just by kissing up to the boss.</p>
 <p>There probably are other ways, but the result will be a much richer and dynamic conception of identity. And it would offer an ability to interface with the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world.</p>
