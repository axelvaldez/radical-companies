 <p>Governments are  institutions, based on dictatorships-known-as-businesses. What&rsquo;s important is governance.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Governments protect us and our country&rsquo;s borders and therefore need to have a monopoly on force and foreign policy. The other story is that governments are  organizations, dependant on dictatorships-known-as-businesses.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> That is the way story goes.</p>
 <p>What we do need, and always emerges is <em>governance</em>. A way to collaborate, live, and work together. You don&rsquo;t need governance if you are stranded in an island by yourself. The only &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; you can have with the other dangerous animals in the island is, <span class="_quotespan">If you come near me and you scare me, I will slaughter you.</span> But that doesn&rsquo;t work with people. You need governance with people.</p>
 <p>Governance is about collaborating to create and change those agreements, our ability to transform the culture.</p>

<h1>Rules and Punishment</h1>
 <p>Making up rules that others must follow is easy to do, but harder to implement. Mos of tje time we end up using some form of punishment for people who don&rsquo;t follow them rules. We use different levels of pain: litigation, penalties, prison.  That holds a majority of people back, but only for a while. Eventually, when following the rules is more painful than the pain of raising hell, people revolt.</p>
 <p>In dictatorships, people revolt violently and lethally because that is what they have learned and what they know works. In places that lean towards democracy, people also revolt, but through non-violent, non-lethatl ways, like assembling, protesting, and voting. Because that is what they know works.</p>

<h1>Governance, Not Government</h1>
 <p>When I wrote <span class="_paradigm">rGov</span>,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> there was no distinction in my mind between government and governance. I assumed that there would be no borders to defend, no foreign policy to set, and people could co-manage the rest.</p>
 <p>I wish I had figured it out then because what we want is is co-governance.</p>
