<div style="display:none;">
 <p>What should it be <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span>, force, or pain. It turns that that <em>pain</em> is the most basic thing.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>It all started with a conversation with Jose. Instead of <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span>, he prefers to speak of <em>force</em>; I was defending <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> <em>the</em> the best label. Needless to say, it wasn&rsquo;t much of <em>conversation</em>. The argument has been bounding around my head for a couple of days. So I went to a contemplative place (the shower) and thought about some more. As it turned out, we met with our fledging <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies right after my shower, so I explained what was going on and let me know what I was leading towards <em>pain</em> as the label as pain, or the avoidance of pain, is closer to the root than fiat or force. Long story short: they had good arguments otherwise.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> carries a threat of force wih it, <span class="_quotespan">move that box from there to there</span>. The implied <em>or else</em> never gets said, but it is always there because I can fire you and threatened your ability to survive.</p>
 <p>As Carlos Suarez said, <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> exploits the the threat of force which can result in pain. So, it is the avoidance of pain that makes us do things the things we don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
 <p>The other route to suvivability is wellbeing. Nobody has to force us to things for our wellbeing. We are happy to do them. Force, fear, and pain simply get in the way of the joy of doing things for our wellbeing.</p>

   alt="At the top of it all, we see FIAT. Below it, we see 'threat of force.' Below and to the right, we see 'Threat of Pain.' Below and to the right, we see 'Fear (avoid Pain).' Below and to the right we see 'Force.' Bellow and to the right, we see 'Pain.' To the far right of that, we see 'Wellbeing.' There are arrows connecting these boxes. Finally, underneath all of it, we see 'Survivability.'"

<h1>Heart-Felt Stories<h1>
 <p>When I came out of the shower I was ready to change <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> to <span class="_paradign">PAIN</span>, but the discussion with the other <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span>s convinced me to stick with <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span>.</p>
 <p>Paty (Patricia) told the story of she got so beaten down by her government job that she hit bottom and decided to quit. She wanted to build a platform to make easy for people to do things for the sake of wellbeing. It turns out that we are building that platform, but not as an app, but a different way of living and thriving.</p>
 <p>Chabeli told us about the start of her transformation by a simple act: telling what she really thought. <span class="_quotespan">Make for people, not just to make money.</span> It took courage to do, but she felt really good. As it turned out, the women that she was working with took her seriously and enjoying the process more.</p>
 <p>These stories were heartfelt and resonated with me. They spoke to the power of having an alternative to the <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> system we live under.</p>
