<div style="display:none;">
 <p>What should it be <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span>, force, or pain. It turns that that <em>pain</em> is the most basic thing.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>It all started with a conversation with Jose. Instead of <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span>, he prefers to speak of <em>force</em>; I was defending <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> the <em>best</em> label. Needless to say, it wasn&rsquo;t much of <em>conversation</em>.</p>
 <p>The argument has been bouncing around in my head for a few days. So I went to a contemplative place (the shower) and thought about some more. As it turned out, we were meeting with <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies right after my shower. I explained what was going on and let them know that I was leaning towards <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> and away from<span class="_paradign">FIAT</span>. <span class="_paradign">PAIN</span>, more so that <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span>, is closer to the root of the <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> system we live in. But they had good arguments to the contrary.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> carries a threat of force wih it, <span class="_quotespan">move that box from there to there</span>. The implied <span class="_quotespan">or else</span> never gets said, but it is always there because I can fire you and threatened your ability to survive. <span class="_quotespan">Move that box from there to there</span> is attended to avoid <span class="_paradign">PAIN</span>.</p>
 <p>As Carlos Suarez said, <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> exploits the the threat of <span class="_paradign">PAIN</span>. So, it is the avoidance of <span class="_paradign">PAIN</span> that makes us do things we wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise do.</p>
 <p>Remarkably, the other route to suvivability is wellbeing. Nobody has to force us to things for our wellbeing, we are happy to do them. <span class="_paradign">FORCE</span>, <span class="_paradign">FEAR</span>, and <span class="_paradign">PAIN</span> simply get in the way of the joy of doing things for our wellbeing.</p>

   alt="At the top of it all, we see the word FIAT. Below it, we see the words 'threat of force.' Below and to the right, we see 'Threat of Pain.' Below and to the right, we see 'Fear (avoid Pain).' Below and to the right we see 'Force.' Bellow and to the right, we see 'Pain.' To the far right of that, we see 'Wellbeing.' There are arrows connecting these boxes. Finally, underneath all of it, we see 'Survivability.'"

<h1>Heart-Felt Stories</h1>
 <p>When I came out of the shower I was ready to change <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> to <span class="_paradigm">PAIN</span>, but the discussion with the other <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span>s convinced me to stick with <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>.</p>
 <p>Paty (Patricia) told the story of when she got so beaten down by her government job that she hit bottom and decided to quit. Instead, she wanted to build a platform to make it easy for people to do things for the sake of their wellbeing. As it turns out, we are building that platform, not as an app, but as a different way of living and thriving.</p>
 <p>Chabeli told us about the start of her transformation by a simple act: telling what she really thought. <span class="_quotespan">Make for people, not just to make money.</span> It took courage to do, but she felt really good. As it turned out, the women that she was working with took her seriously and enjoying the process more.</p>
 <p>These stories were heartfelt and resonated with me. They spoke to the power of having an alternative to the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system we live under.</p>
