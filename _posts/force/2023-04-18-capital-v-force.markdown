<h1>Capital v Force</h1>
 <p>Capital versus force, that is of the things that Karl Mark is remembered for: capital to buy force, versus the proletariat’s sacrificial force. A distinction without a difference. Capitalists won’t have their way anymore based on their capital. A New Man, emancipated from egotism, will rise and will run the (same) <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system on behalf of the proletariat.</p>
 <div class="_speakera">First, the proletariat will take the capitalist down by <em>force</em>. Then they will use the riches they capture to create a system that is fair to the proletariat.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Good. But how will this fair-to-all situation come about?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Well, we will figure that out as we go. In the meantime, we will hold the capital on behalf of the proletariat.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">So you will take over everthing, incluting the capital, and decide what to do with it all, right?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">On behalf of the proletariat, yes!</div>
 
<h1>Blindness</h1>
 <p>Karl Marx was blind to the <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> system. He would have switched the owners, from capitalist to &rdquo;new man,&rdquo; but kept the <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> system itself. In government and businessm, both <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> organizations, that is like putting lipstick on the pig.</p>
 <p>The important thing is to make the <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> system visible to the people it hurts. Finding an alternative will go up in priority.</p>
