<h1>Capital v Force</h1>
 <p>Capital versus force, that is what Karl Mark is warmly remembered for. A distinction without a difference. Capital to buy force, versus the proletariat’s sacrificial force.</p>
 <p>Marx preached that the capitalists won’t have their way anymore based on their capital. A New Man, emancipated from egotism, will rise and will run the (same) <span class="_paradigm">FIAT<span> system on behalf of the proletariat.</p>

<h1>How?</h1>
 <div class="_speakera">First, the proletariat will take the capitalist down by force. Then they will use the riches they capture to create a proletariat paradise.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Good. But how will this proletariat paradise come about?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">We will figure that out as we go. In the meantime, we will hold the capital on behalf of the proletariat.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Meaning, you will take over the capital the capitalists had accumulated and decide what to do with it, right?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">On behalf of the proletariat, right!</div>
 
<h1>Blindness</h1>
 <p>Karl Marx might have sized the problem very well; he may even have made visible what had been to that point invisible. But he was blind to the FIAT system. He just changed the owners, from capitalist to mythical &rdquo;new man.&rdquo;</p>
