 <p>What does a boss in a no-boss world do? After so many years of winning competitions&hellip; do I give that up? Do I reduce the force and become nicer?</p>
 <p>WHAT?</p>
 <p>I guess the only thing ahead is to learn. For the boss to learn to not be boss and the people around her to act like his loving peers.</p>
 <p>It is very, very difficult. It definitely is an obstacle, embrace. That could be the impact that make on the world.</p>
