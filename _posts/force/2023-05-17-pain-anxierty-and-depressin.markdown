 <p>Dr Olusola Ajore, Univerty of Illinois Chicago Professor of Psychiatry, says,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p><span class="_quotatespan">We&rsquo;ve had an incredible explosion of need&hellip; with soaring rates of anxiety and depressiong</span><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>A Different Take</h1>
 <p>My take is that anxiety and depression are two aspects of pain. They are different as far as our brains are concerned, but they are alike in that they cause pain.</p>
 <p>My children both suffered from depression, one of them had it worse than the other. A while back he was diagnosed as having anxiety which causes depression. After some adjustments to newly prescribed medicines, he is doing fine. I am thankful that they found the &ldquo;right&rdquo; parts of the brain to medicate.</p>
 <p>But pain is the common thing.</p>

<h1>p71</h1>
 <p>People born post 1971 grew up in an economy very different from the one I grew up in (I was worn in 1951). For me it was wild growth and oppoutnities all around. Post 1971 it has been no growth and limited opportunities.

 <p>I don&rsquo;t know if there is any correclation or this is just coincidence, but I believe that said &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; of anxiety and depression diagnoses have to do with this. We raised our children for a world that never materialized. And so they are more sensitive to the fact that they are close to pain and there&rsquo;re only limited ways out.</p>
 <p>In any case the &ldquo;out&rdquo; is to the <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> system, something that they&rsquo;ve watched in us and are not excited about. And they don&rsquo;t want it for their children, either.</p>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Exceuse me for repeating myself, but co-ownership, co-management, and something like the <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> system is closer to what they may be wishing for. Self-management is being accepted and celebrated (we call it co-managedment because there really is not &ldquo;self&rdquo; when it comes to an thing, only people can co-manage). Good for co-management, but we also need co-ownership. You are encouraged by experts to &ldquo;think like an owner,&rdquo; but you are not. When you are a co-owner, you behave like an owner, because you are.</p>
