 <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had &hellip; soaring rates of anxiety and depression&rdquo;</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Dr Olusola Ajore, Univerty of Illinois Chicago Professor of Psychiatry, says,</p>
  <div class="_citation">

<h1>A Different Take</h1>
 <p>My take is that anxiety and depression are two aspects of pain. They are different as far as our brains are concerned, but they are alike in that they cause pain.</p>
 <p>My children both suffered from depression, one of them had it worse than the other. A while back he was diagnosed as having anxiety which causes depression. After some adjustments to newly prescribed medicines, he is doing fine. I am thankful that they found the &ldquo;right&rdquo; parts of the brain to medicate.</p>
 <p>But pain is the common thing.</p>

<h1>p71</h1>
 <p>People born post 1971 grew up in an economy very different from the one I grew up in (I was worn in 1951). For me it was wild growth and oppoutnities all around. Post 1971 it has been no growth and limited opportunities.

 <p>I believe that this &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; of anxiety and depression diagnoses have to do with the fact that they economy is not working for post-1971 folks. We raised our children for a world that never materialized. And so they are more sensitive to the fact that they are close to pain and there&rsquo;re only very few, limited ways out.</p>
 <p>In any case the &ldquo;out&rdquo; would be to the <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> system, something that they&rsquo;ve watched their parents go through and are not excited about for themselves or for their children.</p>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Cco-ownership, co-management, and something like the <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> system is closer to what they may be wishing for. Instead of self-managekejt, we call it co-management<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>, but whatever you call it, we also need co-ownership, decentralized ownership.</p>
 <p>I often see <em>experts</em> encouraging you to &ldquo;think like an owner.&rdquo; But you are not, so all that enouragement is wasted.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, as a co-owner you behave like an owner, because you are. No &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; needed.</p>

    We call it co-management because there really is not &ldquo;self&rdquo; when it comes to an thing, only people can co-manage.
