<div style="display:none;">
 <p>What should it be <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span>, force, or pain. It turns that that <em>pain</em> is the most basic thing.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>It all started with a Jose conversation. He prefers to speak of <em>force</em> and I was defending <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> <em>the</em> the best label. Needless to say we were talking at cross purpose. The argument has been bounding around my head for a couple of days. So I went to a contemplative place (the shower) and thought about some more. As it turned out, we met with our fledging <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies right after my shower, so I explained what was going on and let me know what I was leading towards <em>pain</em> as the label as pain, or the avoidance of pain, is closer to the root than fiat or force. Long story short: they had good arguments otherwise.</p>
 <p>Fiat carries a threat of force wih it, <span class="_quotespan">move that box from there to there (or else)</span>. The <em>or else</em> never gets said, but it is always there because I can fire you and threatened your ability to survive.</p>
 <p>Fiat includes the threat of force, may be result in force, which results in pain. So, it is the avoidance of pain that makes do things. The opposite of that is wellbeing. We do things that improve our wellbeing happily and without force.</p>
