<div style="display:none;">
 <p>What should it be <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span>, force, or pain. It turns that that <em>pain</em> is the most basic thing.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>It all started with a Jose conversation. He prefers to speak of <em>force</em> and I was defending <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> <em>the</em> the best label. Needless to say we were talking at cross purpose. The argument has been bounding around my head for a couple of days. So I went to a contemplative place (the shower) and thought about some more. As it turned out, we met with our fledging <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies right after my shower, so I explained what was going on and let me know what I was leading towards <em>pain</em> as the label as pain, or the avoidance of pain, is closer to the root than fiat or force. Long story short: they had good arguments otherwise.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> carries a threat of force wih it, <span class="_quotespan">move that box from there to there</span>. The implied <em>or else</em> never gets said, but it is always there because I can fire you and threatened your ability to survive.</p>
 <p>As Carlos Suarez said, <span class="_paradign">FIAT</span> exploits the the threat of force which can result in pain. So, it is the avoidance of pain that makes us do things the things we don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
 <p>The other route to suvivability is wellbeing. Nobody has to force us to things for our wellbeing. We are happy to do them. Force, fear, and pain simply get in the way of the joy of doing things for our wellbeing.</p>

   alt="At the top of it all, we see FIAT. Below it, we see 'threat of force.' Below and to the right, we see 'Threat of Pain.' Below and to the right, we see 'Fear (avoid Pain).' Below and to the right we see 'Force.' Bellow and to the right, we see 'Pain.' To the far right of that, we see 'Wellbeing.' There are arrows connecting these boxes. Finally, underneath all of it, we see 'Survivability.'"
