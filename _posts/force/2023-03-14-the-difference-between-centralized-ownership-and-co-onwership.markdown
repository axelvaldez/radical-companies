<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Centralized ownership will kill us. Decentralized ownership is beautifull. It is about centralized versus decentralized, not ownership.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>At one point I wrote,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><span class="_quotespan" id="_bolder">&hellip; centralized governance and ownership will destroy us. A lot of folks seem to agree that we have to decentralize decision making (co-management), but we also have to decentralize ownership (co-ownership). We have to let wealth flow to the people who created it. We need to co-ownership in addition to co-management.</span></li>
  </ul>
 <p>It is confusing and not as clear as it needs to be. I have this thing about using the fewest words possible to say things, but sometimes I go way over and this is one case where I did.</p>
 <p>This is what I meant to write,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><span class="_quotespan" id="_bolder">&hellip; centralized governance and ownership will destroy us.</span> &ndash; Emphasis on <span class="_quotespan">centralized.</span></li>
   <li><span class="_quotespan" id="_bolder">Many folks seem to agree that we have to decentralize decision making, but we also have to decentralize ownership.</span> &ndash; <span class="_quotespan">I hope</span> is not the same as <span class="_quotespan">I know,</span> so I changed it. Also, I took out &ldquo;(co-management)&rdquo; and &ldquo;(co-ownership)&rdquo; to avoid confusion.</li>
   <li><span class="_quotespan" id="_bolder">We have to let wealth flow to the people who created it.</span></li>
   <li><span class="_quotespan" id="_bolder">Instead, we must move towards co-ownership (<em>i.e.</em>, decentralized ownership) as well as to co-management (<em>i.e.</em>, decentralized management).</span></li>
  </ul>
