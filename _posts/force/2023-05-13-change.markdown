<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>When you hear, <span class="_quotespan">I hate change</span>, what you are really hearing is <span call="_quotespan">Change is a threat, I am going to fight it. This foxhole is what&rsquo;s protecting me and allowing me to survive</span>. The next foxhole won&rsquo;t do that. And the more you dig yourself in, the more threatining change is.</p>
 <p>What can help you out of the foxhole is other people around you. Peaple you trust. People who move out of the foxhole and survive just fine. Those people are now helping ease you out of your foxhole.</p>
 <p>The boss won&rsquo;t help you get out. He probably can not, but, in any case, it is not in best interest if what you do in your foxhole creates wealth for him. Your community will because they are want your wellbeing.</p>
 <p>Very important: celebrate your getting out because you did it, with other&rsquo;s help, but you did it! You shed the limitations of your old foxhole, party!</p>
 <p>To survive and thrive, evolve and adapt.</p>
