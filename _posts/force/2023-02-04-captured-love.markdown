 <p>The English enclosures of the 16<sup>th</sup>-17<sup>th</sup> century captured more than land: they also captured our essential drive to care for and nourish our social circle. <em>That</em>, as a system, continues to this day.</p>
 <p>We don&rsquo;t just feed ourselves individually, we feed our social circle. We don&rsquo;t just nurse and take care of ourselves individually, we nurse and take care of our social circle. We don&rsquo;t just hug and caress for our individual benefit, we hug and caress for the health of our social circle. That is what we do as social animals and that is what has made us as successful as we are: we have survived and thrived because of our social circle, not as individuals. That is what the English enclosures captured, along with the land. The &ldquo;excess labor&rdquo; that we naturally do for our social circle was now in the hands of <em>legal owners</em>.</p>

 <p>Prejudice is older than this age. &hellip; Among men, however, dissimilarity of <em>minds</em> is a more potent factor in causing prejudice than unlikeness in physiognomy.</p>
 <p id="_signature">Dr Charles Henry Turner (1867â€“1923)<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>Dissimilarity</h1>
 <p>Our ability to detect dissimilarity was the lever and all we had to do was find the rock to leverage it on. Once you are ready to distrust and fear the people on the other side of the line, <em>them people</em>, anything serves. Well dressed people, riding horses and wielding weapons were obviously on side and the raggedy, bare foot, and weaponless mob were on the other.</p>
 <p>This ability to make make up stories about the dissimilar, older than this age, were the rock that we could leverage on. <em>This</em> was a very a powerful innovation, heart-felt on both sides of the line.</p>
 <p>Worse, we can&rsquo;t fight it. The dissimilarity line, the divide, has been in our minds for a long time and we would exhaust ourselves trying to fight it.</p>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>The dissimilarity line is the perfect story for exploitation. Co-ownership is our story for going forward.</p>
 <p>Co-ownership leverages our drive to care for and nourish our social circle, same as always. But, co-ownership welcomes everybody and their contributions, makes us all co-owners by putting decentralizing power and putting it in out hands, the co-owners. </p>
 <p>Co-ownership is our poweful inovation for going forward.</p>
