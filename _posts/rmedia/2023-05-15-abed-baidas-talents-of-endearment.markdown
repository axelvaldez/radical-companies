 <p>Surprisingly branding is best done by children. They still have playfullness left in them. They have not learned to worry about the boss, they are just playing. Abed Baidas claimed it so and he is likely right.</p>
 <p>I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect but it turned out that Abed is a proto-<span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span>. We didn&rsquo;t talk much about co-ownership, but he defintely gets Meaning and Belonging, the floor of the <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> Foundation.</p>
  <div class="_center">

    alt="Imagine a box. The floor is labeled MEANING & BELONGING, things that are fundamental to people. The ceiling is labeled DECENTRALIZATION & TRANSPARENCY,  things fundamental to companies and other groups of people. The ceiling is held up by four columns labeled EXPERIMENTATION, fundamental to all practices."

 <p>Abed turned out to be a delightful person, very open to new ideas and very optimistic. He is Executive Chairman at <em>Talents of Endearment</em> and Founder of the Identity Branding Forum, very financially successful businesses. But that is not important. What is important came out when I told him that he didn't fit my image of somebody from Dubai, <span class="_quotespan">So what happened to you?</span> I had to ask it three times until he said that he had the opportunit of traveling the world early in his life. And then he told me his Brazil story.</p>

<h1>Dunkin Donuts</h1>
 <p>His Brazilian partner and Abed decided to go to a brand new establishment in Brazil: Dunkin Donuts. As the were about to enter, he noticed that a kid was sleeping right outside the place, on the side-walk. They went about their business and on the way out he bought two dozen donuts. Abed placed the boxes next to the kid, not wanting to <span class="_quotespan">disturb his pease.</span> Then he walked across the street and insited on waiting to see what would happen. A few people passed by and looked at the kid and the odd bags of doughnuts next to him. Then an older man looked at the kid and the two boxes next to him, and then proceeded to wake him up. The kid woke up, looked at the older fellow, then looked inside the the bags. He looked up to the older man, then reached out into the bag, took out a doughnut and gave to the man. Then he took off with new found riches.</span>
 <p>It was obvious that the kid&rsquo;s first reaction was to share some of it with the man who had walked him up to it. This had an impact on him, still.</p>
 <p>Later I shared my intention to start a group of proto-<span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> and he immediately offered to help with platforms and what now.</p>
 <p>I am going to modify my image of people from Dubai.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
