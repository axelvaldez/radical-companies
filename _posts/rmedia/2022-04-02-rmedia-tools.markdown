 <p>rMedia Tools.</p>
</div>

<h1>rReader</h1>
 <p>A reader app that works with ebooks and platforms (<em>e.g.</em>, Kindle).</p>
 <h2>Features</h2>
  <p>While on or near a PRADERA SHELF, the READER app can be used to,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Download, listen to, or watch content.</li>
    <li>Upload reviews and other content (i.e., as text, audio, or video).</li>
    <li>Read a book.</li>
    <li>Download the digital book at a discount or get a discount coupon (<em>e.g.</em>, QR code) to buy a paper copy of the book at the hosting store.</li>
   </ul>
 <h2>Highlights</h2>
  <p>The READER allows readers to highlight from one word to a whole fragment. As opposed to the Kindle, a &ldquo;word&rdquo; does not include adjacent punctuation (<em>e.g</em>, single and double quotes, commas, periods, colons, semicolons, ellipses, dashes, parentheses, brackets, and exclamation and question marks) although the user may include it manually by adjusting the selection one character at a time.</p>
  <p>In addition to highlighting, the READER can support underlines, boxes, and other forms of emphasis alone or in combination.</p>

<h1>rShelf</h1>
 <p>The PRADERA SHELF could bring new life to small booksellers and make their business more profitable.</p>
 <h2>Features</h2>
  <p>Retailers would have an area, called the SHELF, dedicated to PRADERA MEDIA content.</p>
  <p>Later, retailers could include other publishers, but they would have to pay a fee to the store for the privilege (at that point the store would probably have to buy the SHELF).</p>
  <p>Mobile phones and pads will readily connect to the SHELF to,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Download/listen/watch content.</li>
    <li>Upload reviews and other content, such as text, audio, or video (see PRADERA MAKE).</li>
    <li>Download the first few chapters of a book for free or the whole book at a discount.</li>
    <li>Get a discount coupon to buy a paper copy of the book at the hosting store.</li>
    <li>See PRADERA READER.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>The SHELF is designed to be noticeable. A couple of elevated chairs could serve as a SHELF or maybe a single booth. This would be a space for quiet reading and also for readers to meet and talk (<em>i.e.</em>, instant book clubs).</p>
  <p>What’s disruptive about this is that,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The SHELF is different and becomes a conversation piece (<em>i.e.</em>, love or hate it, it gets mentioned online).</li>
    <li>The store gets increased foot traffic.</li>
    <li>More book copies are sold.</li>
    <li>PRADERA MEDIA gets all contact info (opt-in) collected at the SHELF.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>Footprints could span from a single-user booth, to a platform with several chairs in it, or even a counter where people could sit and read.</p>

<h1>rMBA</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>Compassion is the radicalism of our time.</p>
  <p id=_signature">Dalai Lama XIV</p>
 </div>
 <h2>Origin Story</h2>
  <p>The idea came up during a conversation with Jose Leal and Marcial Quintanar. One thing led to another and we ended up with rough plans for a <span style="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL MBA</span>.<sup id="bm01"><a href="#en01">1&nbsp;</a></sup></p>
 <h2 class="_section">ENDNOTES</h2>
  <ul style="font-size:smaller; ">
   <li id="en01">
    <p class="_list-item">
     Not the perfect name, but MBA is more accessible. For now.

<h1>rPlayGym</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>The form of association, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations&rdquo;</p>
  <p id='_signature'>John Stuart Mill</p>
 </div>
 <h2>Origin Story</h2>
  <p>This is inspired in part by Cesar Millan’s show The Dog Whisperer. Cesar has a dog “farm” in his oversized backyard where dogs simply behave like&hellip; dogs.</p>
  <p>Most of the time, a dog is “trouble” because of its owner.  These are not dog abusers, on the contrary they treat their dogs as babies, siblings, or roommates and expect them to behave accordingly. But dogs are dogs, not humans and in Cesar’s dog farm they learn to be dogs again by hanging out with dogs who are just dogs.</p>
  <p>A rCircuit would serve a similar purpose, where people would learn to be people again. Not employees. Not resources. Not workers.  Not “senior” this or “junior” that. They learn to be vulnerable and seek help rather than get stuck.</p>
  <p>People spend time at RADICAL companies that are part of the rCircuit. These companies host people so they can experience what it is like to work in an environment that is not fear-driven. Where they can let go of their fear-driven habits and learn new, healthier habits.</p>
