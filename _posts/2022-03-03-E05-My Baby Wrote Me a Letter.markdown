<div style="display: none;">Sammie figures out how to simulate the future that we may get if we keep going this way.</div>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">MY BABY JUST WROTE ME A LETTER</h1>
<p>
It took Kiki several tries but finally Sammie figured out what she was trying to
show her. She hoped that all the technology and people Vic had sicced on her
wouldn’t catch on.
</p>
<p>
It took Sammie a while but she finally figured that Kiki’s note was embedded in
a vase decoration. The vase looked normal enough, but it looked weird to Sammie
because she knew that Kiki was not a fan of having flowers or green around. She
thought it was a senseless waste of energy just to satisfy people’s faux “green
Earth” nostalgia. Even though she had spent her childhood on Surface, she didn’t
miss it. She was extremely allergic to all kinds of vegetation and could roam
around freely only during the deep of winter; most of the  year she had to stay
mostly indoors. There was no greenery inside her house on Surface and no
greenery in our Minor quarters. And that’s why the vase didn’t look right to
Sammie. She realized now that she had seen that vase before, but this was the
first time she noticed it because it blocked a picture of Kiki, Muns, and her.
Kiki must have kept moving it around until Sammie finally caught on.
</p>
<p>
The vase had what looked like an old bar code pattern in it; Sammie figured
those were meant for the Worms. The strips of dark and light patterns were
separated by dirty brownish colored bands and that’s what Sammie focused on. She
could only glance at it now and then not to raise suspicion but she eventually
figured that she was looking at the mirror images of handwritten notes. With the
help of her own neuromorphics she read Kiki’s note on the vase.
</p>

<h2>Like an Orgy with Clothes On</h2>
<p>
Neuromorphics became part of various brain processes and were normally entrained
with their waves. When, say, Sammie wondered about a particular issue, her
neuromorphics would translate it as a request and post it on the Galanet. Once
the response started to trickle back, the neuromorphics injected into the
various brain processes as a recall and it was as if Sammie had known the answer
all along and was just remembering it. That meant that neuromorphics had enough
umph in them to send to and receive from the Galanet but when it was powered
down, the neuromorphics kept posting questions. And then, because of the
electronic silence, somebody else’s neuromorphics would pick up the posts. So
the whispers she heard were transmissions from the neuromorphics of the people
nearby her.
</p>
<p>
Imagine what would happen if somebody had an orgasm during electronic silence.
That’s what Kiki had set out to investigate and her answer was that it would be
like having a group orgy with your clothes on. The neuromorphics attached
themselves to pre cognitive brain areas. That meant that they communicated
mostly feelings that then nudged the cognitive areas this way and that. If
somebody were to have a strong, powerful feeling like an orgasm it would spread
quickly as an orgasmic wave to anybody nearby and from those to others nearby
and so on.
</p>
<p>
Fear is a strong emotion, too, and it would have the same daisy chain effect. It
would happen at the speed of thought but have a lasting impact. From all
indications, Vic didn’t realize this was happening but now Sammie knew and could
use this effect.
</p>

<h2>Orgasmic Waves</h2>
<p>
After the unleashing of Sammie’s Big Nothings she was let out of her quarters.
She was happy, but suspicious at the sudden generosity. There really was no
benefit to keeping her locked up, except she would not be sneaking around
looking for Munjez but she figured that by now he was somewhere unreachable to
Sammie.
</p>
<p>
The unexpected freedom allowed her to experiment with neuromorphic waves. She
experimented with getting really close to people while talking and hugging and
she tried evoking various kinds of feelings, from happiness to despair. At first
it was not clear if the reactions she got were due to the neuromorphics or if
they were just driven by social queues and microexpressions. Then a strange
thing happened: the people sitting at a nearby table seemed to be picking up on
the mood of Sammie’s table. She tried evoking different feelings in different
settings and the effect was reproducible.
</p>
<p>
After many more tries she figured out that it also had to do with the shape of
the space and the amount of people in it. Low ceilings and more crowded
conditions were more conducive to spread the effect.
</p>

<h2>A Fan</h2>
<p>
“I like your new top.” That was Xin who was usually very quiet, a committed
wall-flower type. What surprised Sammie is that she could not think of any new
top… “oh, you mean my teal pajama top?” They had a good laugh and exchanged a
few more words before parting ways soon thereafter.
</p>
<p>
It was odd that Xin had commented on it, really strange. They had never
overlapped as she had come to the habitat way after Sammie had moved on and they
really didn’t know each other. That out-of-the-blue comment left her thinking.
And then it hit her: Sammie had put on her PJs when she started to get ready for
bed—but that was <em>after</em> she had turned off external access to her
Anchortron. So it seemed that Xin was letting her know that she was one of her
watchers and could see inside her cabin without the Anchortron. But how could
she possibly…
</p>
<p>
When she got to her cabin, she gave her Anchortron a look over and she saw it:
one the support columns had been tampered with.  It took her most of the next
morning to do this surreptitiously, but she verified that the one suspicious
column had a very different electronic emission profile than the column on the
other side. She didn’t need to know exactly what was inside to know that they
were now watching her throughout the day.
</p>
<p>
It also explained why they had so “generously” let her out of her cabin.
</p>

<h2>Where Is Vic?</h2>
<p>
For a couple of weeks Sammie had been interacting with as many people as she
could. She played her first-of-Earth fame for all it had and for once she
enjoyed it. They also loved her Surface stories and her descriptions of the open
space and how exhilarating and dangerous they felt. Being this close to people
gave her a chance to use the neuromorphic wave effect. She would start with one
person, then another, and soon a small crowd. They really felt good hanging with
Sammie and their joy led to their feeling more playful, more trusting, and
ultimately more curious. And just then she mentioned the SimMod game she had
developed, “let me know if you’d like to try it.” She would point out that her
SimMod included fast-forwarding time from present conditions. They were
enthralled by the SimMod, very much surprised by them, and shocked by the
results.
</p>
<p>
Some people even changed the starting conditions to well-known historical
situations and then helplessly watched it lead to war. Tweak. Fall to war. Tweak
again and go to war again.
</p>
<p>
One of the features that people liked was running to the Bosses. This signaled
the end of one phase and the start of the next. People could move ahead by
fighting the Boss, just like the late 20th century games, but it would turn out
to be a dead end. You could try figuring a way out by yourself and that would
get you a bit further ahead. But the way out was for people to help each other
and work together. And this included helping each other get past their fears,
helping each other be vulnerable.
</p>
<p>
Sammie was surprised that Vic had not made an appearance in all that time. She
figured that he’d catch up to what she was doing and try the SimMod himself and
then he would figure a way to put a damper on the whole thing. Either that or he
was probably discovering that being a boss and keeping control over people was a
stressful job.
</p>

<h2>The SimMods</h2>
<p>
Kiki was aghast when she realized where she was and what she was looking at.
“Sammie this is more gross than the worstest fiction Mod. Jeez, this looks like
some early century, megamachine kind of crap. Who came up with this?” Even after
Sammie explained it, Kiki was revolted by it.
</p>
<p>
They could hold conversations like this now and then because Xin was helping
them do it “under the radar.” The feed was a deep fake using previous feeds and
there were telltale signs of it, but Xin chose to ignore them then. Anybody
could have watched the recording and detected the deep fake, but the fact was
that nobody bothered to because Vic had not ordered it. Besides, most other
watchers were busy deep in the bowels of the SimMod <em>game</em>.
</p>
<p>
“OK, so… this is the worst that could happen if Vic’s thing goes on to its
logical conclusion?” Sammie had to explain, again, that this was the <em>best
case</em> scenario, not the worst. “Are you sure? I mean, Mods cannot predict
the future!” Sammie was ready for that one, she had run a simulation starting
with the conditions in Germany, Austria, and the surrounding countries in the
1920s and 1930s, and no matter what, it would end up in World War II. Sometimes
with Hitler, and other times without. Sometimes a few years earlier, sometimes
later. Sometimes it would even start in Germany. But in the end, the Great War
carnage happened. People were starting to take the SimMods, and what they
implied, seriously.
</p>
<p>
As one of the smaller Major habitats found out, they were on a path that was
going to turn ugly. This didn’t come out until much later, but a habitat that
started under Vic’s influence had raced ahead. They experimented with a form of
local governance that rejected Surface authority but it also rejected Vic’s. In
fact, it rejected all forms of authority. Kind of like the US Libertarian
movement.
</p>
<p>
They used SimMods expecting who knows what, but they didn’t like the results
they got. No matter how much they tweaked, they would always end up in a brutish
world where people literally had to fend for themselves, in constant violent
battles with others. A world where any sign of help or coordination would be
interpreted as a threat, or worse, a weakness to be exploited. Ironically, the
habitat was one of the first to be alarmed enough to reach out to Earth’s
authorities for help. Of course, Surface was not really an armed “authority” any
more. Mostly, they acted as facilitators and served to have people get back in
touch with what was important to them as a community.
</p>
<p>
This defection and the defections in his own habitat kept Vic very busy. He had
been trying to come up with counters to Sammie’s SimMods, but to no avail.
People were starting to come to him and, no matter what angle he tried, he ended
up not having anything convincing to say. Fear really made things go awry,
terribly so, and you’d end up with all the turn-of-the-century problems. Hidden,
unexamined fear was surprisingly caustic for people and for teams, too.
</p>

<h2>The Results Are In</h2>
<p>
A lot of people at Vic’s habitat were immersed in the SimMods now, including the
watchers and others under Vic’s influence. And they didn’t like what they saw.
These folks had grown up RADICAL and knew how to use their voice and take
responsibility for their actions.
</p>
<p>
Young Adah and her father knocked on Sammie’s door and told her what they had
done to her Anchortron and they were there to undo it if she would let them in.
They removed the sensors she knew about and others that they had placed
throughout the cabin that she hadn’t discovered.
</p>
<p>
People kept dropping by and apologizing for her mistreatment, but she was most
surprised when she opened the door to Dotty who was holding a finicky Munjez.
Munjez had obviously bonded with Dotty and he was a bit reluctant to let go of
her, but the sight of Sammie was the bigger pull. As Dotty came close to handoff
Munjez, Sammie hugged them both. Then she ran to the Anhcortron and talked to
Kiki and Dotty for a while. “It’s amazing how much he had grown in less than
five weeks,” those were Kiki’s first words after seeing Munjez.
</p>
<p>
Later she even talked to the young man who had blocked her from her ship and who
now didn’t know what to do with hands.
</p>
<p>
Finally, she went looking for Vic. She didn’t find him until the next morning,
sitting by himself in the multihall. In fact, when she first approached him he
made a go away gesture without looking. Sammie had to say, “hey, Victor Boswell”
and then he turned around. He looked at Sammie and within a faction of a second
she saw defeat in his eyes, followed by a flash of “I’ll be back” and finally a
deep, blank stare.
</p>
<p>
“Vic, come with me back to the Minor habitat. Munjez came to you, now it’s your
turn.”
</p>
<p>
After a while he looked up at Sammie and slowly shook his head from side to side
in an apparent refusal. But then, he sprung up and said, “I’ll go fold my socks.
Meet you at the dock in 10.” With that Sammie walked back to her cabin and got
ready to go.
</p>
