<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The question comes up often enough: how can I talk about <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> to people who don&rsquo;t know anything about it? What are its Principles? Does <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> have a structure?</p>
 <p>Note that &ldquo;principles&rdquo; and &ldquo;structure&rdquo; are a reflection of <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> concerns. So, these questions really are about centralization: &ldquo;Right, but who&rsquo;s the boss who set up these principles and structures?&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, you can address these types of questions by talking about the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> tools you do have,</p>

  <li>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Foundations</li>
 </ol>
 <p>You can read about the first two in previous posts. This post is about the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Foundations.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Foundation Template</h1>
 <p>Our deepest problems are the inescapable side-effects of the system we live in: our collapsing climate, the expanding wealth, and wellbeing, gap, discrimation against people of color, the exploitation of women. Instead, we need a generative way of relating to one another, a different paradigm. As we see it, businesses are the place to start. Businesses-as-dictatorship are the root of the problem, so they must be the incubators for what comes next.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model, a <em>company</em> is simply a group of people who come together to build something bigger than themselves. The word "company" comes from the Latin prefix con-, meaning together, and pan, meaning bread. A company then is a group of people who work and socialize together.</p>
 <p>Every company is different because the people who embody it are different. What fundamentally makes a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company different from a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business is that it starts from this simple Foundation.</p>

    <p>This is not absolute, either: you can move towards Transparency or away from it.</p>

   <td>
    <p>This is not absolute: you can move towards Decentralization or away from it. Just be transparent to yourself and others about what you are doing.</p>

    <p>Means never having to say you’re sorry. But you must tell what you’ve learned from the experiment. If you don’t, nobody, including you, can learn from it. Even saying, &ldquo;I don’t know why it went wrong&rdquo; means we learned something from it.</p>
    <p>BTW, whether you do this out loud or written or what have you, it’s something that you all need to agree on from the outset.</p>
