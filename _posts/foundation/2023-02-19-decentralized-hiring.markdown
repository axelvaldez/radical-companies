 <p>Imagine that a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company uses Banners to propose a project. The Banner includes its description including the skills and resources they might need. After a period of giving it shape, the Banner is funded.</p>

<h1>First Team, First Failure</h1>
 <p>As a decentralized company, everybody participates in strategizing. That is generally a good thing, but, in this case, people can’t agree on what strategy to take. Even though these people are co-owners, they are frozen and can’t take the next step.</p>
 <p>It could be because these people have lived their whole life in a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> environment. Not used to making decisions, they would act this way.</p>

<h1>Another Team, Another Failure</h1>
 <p>Then another team would take over after figuring out that something must be done differently. So they <em>elect</em> a <em>chief strategist</em> and commit to following whatever decision their chief strategist comes up with.</p>
 <p>Again, they fail to meet expectations, too. Perhaps the chief strategist didn’t know what he was doing but having drunk from the power cup, he could not put it down.</p>

<h1>Yet Another Team and… Success!</h1>
 <p>Then another team takes over. This time they talk among themselves only to discover that there are at least two people that they should listen to. You wouldn’t know unless you ask, but, as part of their conversation, they asked!</p> <p>They then run through a Trust Agreement, and, as a result, end up agreeing to an Explicit Alignment.</p>
 <p>The two strategists are not that far apart and end up working as a team, with everybody’s support and participation.</p>
 <p>This time, the project meets expectations.</p>

<h1>And Now…</h1>
 <p>Now that you have read this, don’t wait until this happens to you, make it part of a workshop that would-be <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span>s have available to them.</p>
 <p>Help people learn and grow.</p>
