<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> foundation can be made a bit simpler and more focused.</p>
 <p>In the book <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL COMPANIES</span>, we described the foundation like this,</p>
 <table align="center">
  <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE; ">
   <th>principles&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
   <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="_spacer"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>commitments&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
   <td>Transparency & Decentralization</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="_spacer"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE; ">
   <th>practices&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
   <td>Alignment & Experimentation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="_spacer"></td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 <p>At pivotal points, having a foundation helps you get oriented along the path you have chosen: Will this action help us to develop and grow as people? Will this decision make us more centralized or more decentralized? Are we being too rigid or are we still learning from experimentation?</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>The remainder of this post is about a slightly revised <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> foundation.</p>

<h1>Meaning and Belonging</h1>
 <p>Meaning and Belonging cannot be separated. Belonging is key to Meaning to the individual, but it is something we get primarily from &ldquo;the others&rdquo; in the community I Belong to. If I make a spear to fish, it becomes significant to myself next time I am hungry and I eat the fish that I caught with my spear. But when I see <em>somebody else</em> make a spear like mine to fish, that is when my expression becomes a contribution!</p>
 <p>Rather than &ldquo;principles,&rdquo; this sould relabled &ldquo;people&rdquo; to make it super-obvious that people are the basis of it all.</p>

<h1>Decentralization & Transparency</h1>
 <p>Decentralization and Transparency are somewhat redundant.</p>
 <p>At the completely decentralized end everything will be 100% transparent. Completely decentralized means completely transparent.</p>
 <p>On the way to full decentralization you may consider keeping some things secret. The person charged with keeping them would be a boss of those secrets. The question, then, would be, &ldquo;Who is going to be the boss? Who is going to be in charge of these secrets?&rdquo; No matter if this is a very nice person, or a small, trusted committee with a term limit: so long as there are secrets, there is a boss.</p>
 <p>Even though these are redundant, we need to make them both explicit. Sometimes we think we are decentralizing but when we look at the Transparency side we see incoherence. Yes, decentralization implies transparency, but we need one to keep us honest about the other.</p>

<h1>Explicit Alignment & Experimentation</h1>
 <p>Finally, we come to a leg of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> foundation that needs to be changed.</p>
 <p>I was never very happy with the combination of <em>Explicit Alignment</em> and <em>Experimentation</em> under Practices. I have now realized that Explicit Alignment is a tool &ndash; one that is key and absolutely necessary, but it&rsquo;s just a tool.</p>
 <p>Experimentation, on the other hand, applies to every <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> practice. The result may or may not meet our hypothesis (<em>i.e.</em>, our expectations), but even when it does not, it serves to teach us a lesson.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>
 <p>Toos are not technically a part of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> foundation itself; you can be on the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> path and use diffferent tools. No matter, this is what we&rsquo;ve come up with, so far,</p>
 <table align="center">
  <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE; ">
   <th><em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em></th>
   <td>This is the most general tool in that it can be used by any one community or an ensemble of communities. For more, see,

  <tr>
   <th>Explicit<br>Alignment</th>
   <td>This applies to a group of people working on a common project (<em>i.e.</em>, what we call a company). However you choose to express them, these are the key components that you must consider,

  <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE; ">
   <th>Trust<br>Agreements</th>
   <td>Inspired by J Kim Wright&rsquo;s Concious Contracts&reg;, these apply to <em>individuals</em> as they create or enter a <em>community</em>. Its goal is to make explicit that which usually remains hidden for fear of being ridiculed or rejected. It is the start of trust building in a safe pace (psycholgically abd physically).</td>
