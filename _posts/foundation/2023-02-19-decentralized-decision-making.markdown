 <p><span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>s kick off the process of expanding the co-owner base.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Imagine that a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company uses BANNER to propose a project. The BANNER includes its description including the skills and resources they might need. After a period of giving it shape, the BANNER is funded.</p>

<h1>First Team, First Failure</h1>
 <p>As a decentralized company, everybody participates in strategizing. That is generally a good thing, but, in this case, people can&rsquo;t agree on what strategy to take. Even though these people are co-owners, they are frozen and can&rsquo;t take the next step.</p>
 <p>It could be because these people have lived their whole life in a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> environment. Not used to making decisions, they would act this way.</p>

<h1>Another Team, Another Failure</h1>
 <p>Then another team would take over after figuring out that something must be done differently. So they <em>elect</em> a <em>chief strategist</em> and commit to following whatever decision their chief strategist comes up with.</p>
 <p>Again, they fail to meet expectations, too. Perhaps the chief strategist didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing but having drunk from the power cup, he could not put it down.</p>

<h1>Yet Another Team andâ€¦ Success!</h1>
 <p>Then another team takes over. This time they talk among themselves only to discover that there are at least two people that they should listen to. You wouldn&rsquo;t know unless you ask, but, as part of their conversation, they asked!</p> <p>They then run through a Trust Agreement, and, as a result, end up agreeing to an Explicit Alignment.</p>
 <p>The two strategists are not that far apart and end up working as a team, with everybody&rsquo;s support and participation.</p>
 <p>This time, the project meets expectations.</p>

<h1>And Now&hellip;</h1>
 <p>Now that you have read this, don&rsquo;t wait until this happens to you, make it part of a workshop that would-be <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span>s have available to them.</p>
 <p>Help people learn and grow.</p>
