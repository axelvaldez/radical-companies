 <p>For authors, bloggers, and podcasters REMARK! is primarily a source of specific, actionable feedback about their content. They get the highlighted passages, the number of positive and negative clicks, and comments associated with each. These may or may not get monetized.</p>

 <p>UIs have gone from functional, to graphical, to gesture, to responsive. The Attentive UI is what comes next. As the user works with the US, it auto-morphs to make the UI fit the user’s behavior. This could be as simple as rearranging menus and making the most used items easier to reach in a given context. For example, with Photoshop, I may use the brush tool a lot in one case (painting), and I may not use it at all in others.</p>
