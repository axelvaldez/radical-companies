<h1>Religion</h1>
 <p>Will <em>Radical</em> change <em>religion</em> over time? Zarahustra&rsquo;s invemntion of  <EM>a Supreme GOD</EM> did!</p>

 <p>Unfortunately it was centralized on a Boss GOD. Only the most powerful man in the land could interpret his wishes.</p>

 <p>The Vatican try to be <EM>Da Ruler</EM> of Christiandom, but they ended playing second banana as an arbiter to Christian Kings and Queens.</p>

 <p>Eventually it changed the approach to <EM>governance</EM>.</p>
