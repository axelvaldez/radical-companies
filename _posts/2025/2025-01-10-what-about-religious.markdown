<h1>Religion</h1>
 <p>Will <em>Radical</em> change <em>religion</em> over time? Zarahustra&rsquo;s invemntion of  <EM>a Supreme GOD</EM> did!</p>

 <p>Unfornately it was centralized on <EM>one</EM> Boss-God. And only the most powerful man in the land could interpret his wishes. The Vatican try to rule over all, but they ended to playing second banana as an arbiter to Kings and Queens, and the the US and its Constitution happened out of the Renaissance.</p>

 <p>Eventually it changed the many Kings&rsquo; approach to <EM>governance</EM>.</p>
