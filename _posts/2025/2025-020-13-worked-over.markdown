 <p>Another view of Radical.</p>
 <p>This is from a book by <em>Dimitra Doukas</em> called <em>Worked Over: The Corporate Sabotage of American Community</em>. It did not look like much at first, but it completely captured me after I started reading it.</p>

<h1>Ethnography?</h1>
 <p>This seems to be &ldquo;<em>another view of Radical</em>&rdquo;. This time for an &ldquo;ethnograpic&rquo; point of view.</p>

 <p>This is from the book by <em>Dimitra Doukas</em> called <em>Worked Over: The Corporate Sabotage of American Community</em>. The book did not look like much at first, but it completely captured me when I started reading it,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>The rise of corporate giants &hellip; upended a culture of &ldquo;traditional American values&rdquo; that had jelled around the virtue of hard work and suspicion of great wealth, in pursuit of sustainable &lsquo;equality&rsquo; (Page 6).</p>
  </div>
 <p>I am not sure if it was the mentions of <em>&ldquo;community&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;</em>, or <em>&rdquo;suspicion of great wealth&rdquo;</em>, but it really resonated with me.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;Free Country&rdquo;</h1>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>If the capitalists succeed in their quest for power &hellip;, then the sign of free country might as well be taken down</em></p>
  </div>
 <p>But a &ldquo;free country&hellip; &rdquo; is what we must be ready to defend and make sure it continuous to be <em>free</em>.</p>

<h1>All the People</h1>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>&ldquo;&hellip; that the profits from the cooperation of <em>all people</em> went to <em>the people</em>,</p>
  </div>
 <p>Here is the problem with that sentence,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><em>Who</em> is this so called &ldquo;<em>the people</em>?&rdquo;</li>
   <li><em>How</em> is this benefit going to be distributed?</li>
   <li>Based on <em>what</em>?</li>
   <li>By <em>whom</em> is it going to be distributed?</p
  </ul>
  </div>
 <p>The problem is that this could be interpreted in many ways including that <em>the work of the people</em> would go to <em>the people</em>. This could have started something very similar to Radical!</p>

<h1>The Many & The Few</h1>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>&ldquo;<em>&hellip; the great drainage companies fastenend upon America&lsquo;s prosperity</em>&rdquo; saw to it that &ldquo;<em>the proceeds of the labor of many [went] into the pockets of the few.</em>&rdquo;</p>
  </div>
 <p>And this is stil happening. For example, Elon Musk is the richest person in the world, as of the writing of this post. <em>I imagine that other wealthy people are quietly competing with him</em>. Perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Slim" target="_blank">Carlos Slim Hel&uacute;</a>, a Mexican, of Lebanesee descent, the second richest personkn tne world.</p>
