 <p>Another view of Radical</p>
</div>

<h1>Ethnography?</h1>
 <p>I this this &ldquo;<em>another view of Radical</em>&rdquo; because it seems to be just that, but this time for an &lsquo;ethnograpic&rsquo; point of view.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>This is from the begining of the book by <em>Dimitra Doukas</em> called <em>Worked Over: The Corporate Sabotage of American Community</em> published in 2003. The book did not look like much when at first, but I completetly turned around when I read this,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>The rise of corporate giants &hellip; upended a culture of <em>traditional American values</em> that had jelled around the <em>virtue of hard work</em>, and suspicion of great wealth, in pursuit of sustainable &lsquo;equality.&rsquo;</p>
  </div>
 <p>I am not sure if it waa the mentions of <em>&ldquo;community&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;</em>, or <em>&rdquo;suspicion of great wealth&rdquo;</em>, but it really resonated with me.</p>

<h1>Free Country&hellip; ?</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>If the capitalists succeed in their quest for power, unionists asserted, &lsquo;<em>then the sign of </em>free country<em> might as well be taken down.</em>&lsquo;</p>
 </div>
 <p>But the sign of &ldquo;<em>free country might as well be taken down</em>&rdquo; is what we have to be ready to fight against at any time.</p>

<h1>All. The People.</h1>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>&ldquo;&hellip; that the profits from the cooperation of <em>all people</em> would go to <em>the people</em>,</p>
  </div>
 <p>Here is the problem with that sentence,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><em>Who</em> is this so called &ldquo;<em>the people</em>?&rdquo;</li>
   <li><em>How</em> is this benefit going to be distributed?</li>
   <li>Based on <em>what</em>?</li>
   <li>By <em>whom</em> is it going to be distributed?</p
  </ul>
  </div>
 <p>The problem is that this could be interpreted in many ways including that <em>the work of the people</em> would go <em>to [all] the people</em>. A perhaps careless mistake opens the door to all kinds of criticism.</p>
 <p>Worse, this was on the right path, but impulsive. Imagine if this would have ended uo spawning Radical!</p>

<h1>The Many. The Few.</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>&ldquo;<em>&hellip; the great drainage companies fastenend upon America&lsquo;s prosperity</em>&rdquo; saw to it that &ldquo;<em>the proceeds of the labor of many [went] into the pockets of the few.</em>&rdquo;</p>
 </div>
 <p>This is stil happening: Elon Mush is the richest person in the world and I imagine that other wealty people are quietly competing with him. Perhaps <link rel="stlesheet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Slim">Carlos Slim Hel&uacute</link>&mdash;but maybe not.</p>
