 <p>The Itsum Story</p>
</div>

<h1>Decentralization & Transparency</h1>
 <p>Decentralization and Transparency always came and went together. They held hands, like good friends.</p>

<h1>Decentralization</h1>
 <div>
  <img src="/assets/img/pic-childrens-the-itsums-story-06.svg"  size="70%">
 </div>
 <p>Decentralization did not like rules that applied to <em>everybody</em> regardless of their will. He did not like the effect it had on Itsums.</p>
 <p>It liked helping Itsums to make and change their own rules. &ldquo;<em>But it will be chaos</em>,&rdquo; they yelled from the Fiat House. &ldquo;<em>&ldquo;So idealistic for Pete&rsquo;s sake!</em>. &mdash;they said to instill fear. What they did not say is that it may be that way, <strong><em>if</em></strong> your autonomy depends on it because it definiteluy puts at risk.</p>
 <p>But it does not have to be that way.</p>
 <p>In the Radical House Itsums <em>experimented</em> with their work and either got it done, and learn how to do it or learn how not to do it.</p>

<h1>Transparency</h1>
  <div>
   <img src="/assets/img/pic-childrens-the-itsums-story-07.svg"  size="70">
  </div>
 <p>Transparency went around reminding Itsums to not keep things that they forgotten to make tramsparemt. If it existed, others must be able to find out about it.</p>
 <p>No trade secrets. No trademarks. No Non-Disclosures. No secrets whatsoever.</p>
 <p>But they always are inadvertent secrets.</p>
 <p>And that is why Transparency went around reminding Itsums to bring their <em>inadvertent secrets</em> out into the sunshine</p>
 <p>It sure took work to answer questions, but it was worth it. In fact, sometimes answering a question suggested an improvement or a better way to explaining it. And <EM>that</EM> was very satisfying.</p>

<h1>About RADs</h1>
 <p>In the Fiat House everything came from the Supreme Boss through the minor bosses.</p>
 <p>In the Foundation House RADs <EM>replace</EM> all bosses. Radical House Itsums gave RADs to each other so there was no need for Bosses.</p>
 <p>RADs is how things are distributed at the Radical House. Money, food, are all distributed through RADs. If one Itsum had twice as many RADs as another, it gets twice as many goodies as the other. RADs makeeverything ho]]go in the Itsum community.</p>

<h1>And So&hellip;</h1>
 <p>Fiat is a system to accumulate money. We need the Radical system for living.</p>
