 <p>The Itsum Story</p>
</div>

<h1>Progress</h1>
 <p>The Fiat Shack had more and more Itsums in it. some willingly and ome not so willingly. So Fiat had to build a House. The Itsums who moved to the new House called themselves Chieftains. And as they became more prosperous they just called themselves <em>Executives</em>.</p>

 <p>Itsum Fiat had a whole wing of the Fiat House to himself.</p>

 <p>Every one of the Itsums who lived the Fiat House literally adored Fiat. The others were moved to the Fiat Shack by the Itsum called Violence.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, the Fiat Shack had fallen badly into disrepair, but the Rabble could still fit in tightly. And that was fine for them.</p>

<h1>The Rabble</h1>
 <p>The Rabblef had to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities. Itsum Violence made sure they did the work and then head back to the Shack.</p>

 <p>Itsums in the Fiat Shack had fallen out of grace with King Fiat (his new title). Some of them had even tried to help other Itsums, which show how stupid they were because they obviously did not know that the Rabble could not be helped. Fiat had decreed it.</p>

 <p>In any case, the Itsums in the Fiat Shack were the perfect replacements as others disgraced Itsums were falling back to pieces from what they hard work.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
 <p>It seemed that Fiat had built the perfect House to attract and entrap Itsums. Even when they were things that aimed to change the Fiat. The Fiat House became veryn good at absorving all change,</p>

 <p>The Fiat House was good at corrupting and eating up everything that got in its way.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>But it all changed when Radical came together. King Fiat immediately <em>felt</em> the impact.</p>

  </div>
 <p>Radical went over to the Fiat House to talk to them, but King Fiat did not want to talk to Radical.</p>
 <p>The other Itsums in the Fiat House just tried to confuse Radical. He found it very strange that Itsums did not want to talk and were more interested in confusing other Itsums.</p>
 <p>Back in the Foundation House, Radical talked to the Itsums and learned that every time they tried to talk they were beaten.</p>

<h1>The Radical Foundation</h1>
  <div>
   <img src="/assets/img/pic-childrens-the-itsums-story-04.svg" size="70%">
  </div>
 <p>Radical thought and thought and eventually came out with a Foundation wth thenhelp of Meaning, & belonging, Decentralization & Transparencey. and Curios & Experimentation.</p>
 <p>It knew that Itsums had different sensitivies. It also knew that they would not want dogma like a constitution or yet another  structure.</p>

 <p>Radical was aware that the Fiat House might corrupt the Foundation, so Radical made the Radical Foundation very simple and easy to remember so even if they corrupted it Itsums could remember the original Foundation.</p>

 <p>The Foundation would encourage them to compare their ideas with the Foundation.</p>

<h1>Nothing New</h1>
 <p>In the past other Itsums had identified the many problems that the Fiat House brought, but the wayntomreolve it were too specific and narrow.</p>

<h1>Radical Foundation</h1>
 <div>
  <img src="/assets/img/pic-childrens-the-itsums-story-05.svg" size="70%">
 </div>

 <p>Anything that goes against the Radical Foundaton it is really a Fiat organization in disguise. Fiat organizations are OK, too.<em>if others agree to live in it</em>.</p>

 <p>We do not want to compete with the many ills brought courtesy of the Fiat House. We simply want an alternative for living healthy lives.</p>
