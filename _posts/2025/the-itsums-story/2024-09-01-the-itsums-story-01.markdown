 <p>The Itsum Story</p>
</div>

<h1>Meaning & Belonging</h1>
 <p>Like all Itsums, Meaning put himself together from pieces left on the floor.</p>

 <p>Meaning wanted to underdant his motivations and what brought him to do one thing versus another</p>

 <p>Belonging put himself together from the pieces that he believed would make him more sensitive to other Itsums and what they wanted (not necessarily what they said).</p> 

 <p>Itsums Meaning and Belonging became very close friends. They were buddies with many other Itsums, including Fiat.</p> 

<h1>Decentralization & Transparency</h1>
 <p>Decentralization had been around for a while, always teaching alternatives to Itsums that always wanted somebody to tell what to do.</p>

 <p>Transparency was hard to see, but when Decentralization he really saw Transparency they knew they were going to be very close friends.</p>

 <p>They were buddies with many other Itsums, including Fiat.</p>

<h1>Curiosity & Experiment</h1>
 <p>Curiosity is always very curious. He is always nudging Experiment when his experiments do not work as expected. &ldquo;Try it again, change it a little.&rdquo;. and with big smile. &ldquo;Now <em>you know</em> one more way it does not work!&rdquo;</p>

 <p>Itsum <em>Experiment</em> was always in &ldquo;<em>let&rsquo;s try</em>&rdquo; mode, although Itsum Curiosity&rsquo;s encouragement was good. &ldquo;The reality is,&rdquo; Itsum Experiebnt thought, &ldquo;that <em>we are always doing things from scratch</em>.&rdquo;</p>

 <p>Curiosity and Experiment became very close.</p>

 <p>They were buddies with many other Itsums, including Fiat.</p>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>These Itsums,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Meaning and Belonging</li>
   <li>Decentralization and Transparency</li>
   <li>Curiosity and Experimenting</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Foundatiomn</h1>
 <p>They all came together and made up the <em>Radical Foundation</em> which gave Itsums the healthy path.</p> 

 <p>From that come everything Radical.</p>

<h1>Co-Managers</h1>
 <p>Co-management means <em>no managers</em>. The people working together as a company managed <em>the work</em>.</p>

 <p>If your mom or dad are managers, they can continue to be part of a <em>Fiat Business.</em></p>

 <p>However, if they join, or even create, a <em>Radical Company</em> they can work therenas well and work on anything they want, as long as their team knows.</p>

<h1>Co-Owners</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership means <em>no owners</em>. Co-ownership is partner to co-management. People accumulate ownership as they contribute to what everybody came together for.</p>

 <p>The Radical House is co-owned by all the Itsums. They collaborate to get things done. They speack up if something sounds &ldquo;funny.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>RADs</h1>
 <p>Contributions gets converted to RADs and then to money, candy, toys&hellip;</p>
