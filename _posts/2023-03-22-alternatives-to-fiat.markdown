<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>I just saw the quote above in one of Blair Fix&rsquo;s papers entitled <span class="_quotespan">Redistributing Income Through Hierarchy,</span></p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <span class="_quotespan">It is not intelligent, it is not beautiful, it is not just, it is not virtuous &ndash; and it doesn’t deliver the goods. In short, we dislike it, and we are beginning to despise it. But when we wonder what to put in its place, we are extremely perplexed.</span>
   <span id="_signature">John Maynard Keynes.</span>
</div>
  <p>This shows how difficut it is to see past what people call capitalism, where JM Keynes admitted to be <span class="_quotespan">extremely perplexed.</span>. The problem is not the accumulation of capital, but the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
   <div class="_citation">
    <span class="_quotespan">Hierarchies are perhaps the dominant feature of our working lives. Yet paradoxically, they rarely enter into mainstream theories of income distribution.</span>
   </div>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system is based on competition and domination and capital happens to be a very efficient form tool of domination. Our alternative, the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> system, is based on contribuions, instead of capital. This, we believe, will produced more of a life nourising system.</p>

<h1>The Forever Obstacle</h1>
 <p>The obstacle has been to decide <em>what is a contribution</em>. We are so used to the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchical model that we immediately jump to rules and benevolent judges. But as it always happen benevolent judges don&rsquo;t stay benevolent for a long time and rules always sprout a bureaucracy around them.</p>
 <p>So, what are we to do? how we not end up <span class="_quotespan">extremely perplexed.</span></p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> system, ownership is distributed to all co-owners based on their contributions. For any one co-owner, call her Sam, all other co-owners determine what her contributions are. The are no rules and every co-owner figures out what a contribution is. It would be somebody&rsquo;s smile, a particular (computer) code check-in, or a reorganizing of the warehouse. As a co-owner, whatever you recognize as a contribution, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
