<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>I just saw the quote above in one of Blair Fix&rsquo;s papers entitled <span class="_quotespan">Redistributing Income Through Hierarchy</span>.</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <span class="_quotespan">It is not intelligent, it is not beautiful, it is not just, it is not virtuous &ndash; and it doesn’t deliver the goods. In short, we dislike it, and we are beginning to despise it. But when we wonder what to put in its place, we are extremely perplexed.</span>
   <span id="_signature">John Maynard Keynes.</span>
</div>
  <p>This shows how difficut it is to see past what people call capitalism, but really is the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
   <div class="_citation">
    <span class="_quotespan">Hierarchies are perhaps the dominant feature of our working lives. Yet paradoxically, they rarely enter into mainstream theories of income distribution.</span>
   </div>
 <p>The problem is that the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system is based on competition and domination and capital happens to be a very efficient form tool of domination. Our alternative is have a system based on contribuions, instead of capital. This, we believe, will produced more of a life nourising system, which we call the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> system.</p>
 <p>The obstacle has been to decide what is a contribution. We are so used to the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchical model that we immediately jump to rules and benevolent judges. But as it always happen benevolent judges don&rsquo;t stay benevolent for a long time and rules always sprout a bureaucracy around them.</p>
 <p>So, what do we do if we don&rsquo;t want to rely on benevolence and bureaucracy? That&rsquo;s how we end up <span class="_quotespan">extremely perplexed.</span></p>
