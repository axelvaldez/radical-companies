 <p>Co-ops could be based on the RADICAL model. Kind of.</p>

<h1>One Person, One RAD</h1>
 <p> It’d be easy to do if you decided to break the RAD Distribution a little and you kept the RADs instead of giving it to someone else. Every day you get, and keep, a RAD, and so do all your co-workers and your bosses. Full equality for every member of the co-ops.</p>
 <p>All the other RADICAL stuff would remain the same.</p>

<h1>Why RADs Then?</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>You could still give your RADs to BANNERSs. For example, if somebody puts up a BANNER to clean and beautify a nearby river walk, you could give some of your RADs to it.</li>
  <li>When somebody leaves the co-op, they take their RADs with them. They earned them and they continue to get whatever is factored through these RADs. But they don’t receive any new RADs. Given that the total RADs goes up every day. This means that the fixed number a person takes with him goes down as a percentage of total RADs.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>And Co-Management?</h1>
 <p>That was equal co-ownership, regardless of contributions, but co-ownership nevertheless. So, what about co-management?</p>
 <p>Co-ops generally have traditional FIAT hierarchies in place. In Italy, many (most?) co-ops have had the same bosses for many, many years. Mondragon, in Spain, has alway had a FIAT hierarchy in place. “But they are elected by the community.” Yes, but it ain’t co-management because it is managed by a FIAT hierarchy. It still carries the presumption that the little people need a boss to tell them what to do.</p>
 <p>My guess is that of the co-ops that decide to go RADICAL they will try co-management, and at least a few will adopt it permanently.</p>
