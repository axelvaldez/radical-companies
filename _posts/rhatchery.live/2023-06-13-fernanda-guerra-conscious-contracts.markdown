<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Fernanda Guerra is one of those people that recognize a good thing when they see it. And that is how she went for Conscious Contracts: she saw the good in them right away.</p>
 <p>She is a lawyer but she knew that the rule of laws weren&rsquo;t doing the job. They were good for building walls, but not so for building bridges among people. The way she described it, people come first and the rule of law is there to support the relationship.</p>

<h1>For Hours</h1>
 <p>We extended the interview to 55 minutes, but could have talked with her for hours.</p>
