 <p><span class="_quotespan">We are currently facing the biggest social, economic, and cultural opportunity of our lifetimes</span>, that is what Leo believes.</p> We have a chance to regenerative world instead of the one we&rsquo;ve created, the ones that is eating itself.</p>
 <p>Leo was a marketeer, but he made a career changing decision a year ago. Instead of word-smithing green-washing messages, show the world how to become sustainable. He works with big (BIG) companies, but he has more hope for smaller ones who can learn to be good to our life support system and grow faster.</p>
 <p>I believe that truly sustainable businesses will differentiate themselves and thrive. Many with stay in the <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> trough, but some will choose non-<span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> ways,</p>

 <p><span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> is the water that we fish live in. It is so encompassing that it has become invisible, like air,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>Some 2,500 years ago, the ancient Greeks identified air</p>
  </div>
 <p>We don&rsquo;t have a label for the system we have created, so we called <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span>, <span class="_quotespan">Because I say so,</span> with an implied three, <spanb class="_quotespan:=">or elese</span>. That is the system we live in.</p>

 <p>The alternative non-<span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> system does not yet exist, but it will.</p>
