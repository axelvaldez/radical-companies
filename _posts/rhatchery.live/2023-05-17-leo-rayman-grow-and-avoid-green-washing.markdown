 <p><span class="_quotespan">We are currently facing the biggest social, economic, and cultural opportunity of our lifetimes</span>, that is what Leo believes.</p> We have a chance to regenerative world instead of the one we&rsquo;ve created, the ones that is eating itself.</p>
 <p>Leo was a marketeer, but he made a career changing decision a year ago. Instead of word-smithing green-washing messages, show the world how to become sustainable. He works with big (BIG) companies, but he has more hope for smaller ones who can learn to be good to our life support system and grow faster.</p>
 <p>I believe that truly sustainable businesses will differentiate themselves and thrive. Many with stay in the FIAT trough, but some will adopt non-FIAT ways,</p>
