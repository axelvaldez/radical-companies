<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The conversation with Kendell quickly went into a direction that took me by suprise. I fully expected that Kendell was going to push the subscription model as an answer for everything. Instead we ended up talking about the economy and it was not working for young people.</p>
 <p>Buying a house, going for vacation once a year, and that sort of thing are not available to people born in the 1980s. This didn&rsquo;t become clear until after the year 2000s.</p>

<h1>Trapped</h1>
 <p>Kendell said words to the effect that young people would be trapped by house payments, rent, and car payments. That made me sit up because it was another way of saying that the economy is not working for anybody, but it particularly isn&rsquo;t working for the young.</p>
 <p>For my generation (<em>i.e.</em>, I was born in 1951) the believe was that if you &ldquo;got good grades&rsquo; and &ldquo;worked hard&rsquo;, you had a chance to do better than your parents. And indeed, that was the case for some of us (<em>i.e.</em>, white, lower middle-class). But that is not the case any more for the great majority of our young people. The belief is gone overwhelmed by the reality that they have to deal with. So, fuck it.</p>

<h1>Fuller</h1>
 <p>Buckminster Fuller talked about making things lighter. The Dymaxion House, the Dymaxion Car were meant to be physically lighter. But another way to make things <em>lighter</em> is to not having a house or a car and susbcribing to it instead. With Airbnb I can &ldquo;posses&rsquo; a house for a week, or a month and then move on to the next. I can &ldquo;posses&rsquo; a ride, and a driver, by renting one temporarily. That is a &lsquo;light&rsquo; as it gets.</p>
