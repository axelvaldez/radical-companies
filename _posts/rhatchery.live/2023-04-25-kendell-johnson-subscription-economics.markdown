<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The conversation with Kendell quickly went into a direction that took me by suprise. I fully expected that Kendell was going to push the subsecription model as an answer for everything. Instead we ended up talking about the economy and it was not working for young people. Buying a house, going for vacation once a year, and that sort of thing were not available to people born after the 1980s. It wasn&rsquo;t until the year 2000 and beyond that it became clear, but the writing had been on the wall for a while.</p>
