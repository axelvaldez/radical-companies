 <p>The conversation with Kendell quickly went into a direction that took me by suprise. I fully expected that Kendell was going to push the subsecription model as an answer for everything. Instead we ended up talking about the economy and it was not working for young people. Buying a house, going for vacation once a year, and that sort of thing were not available to people born after the 1980s. It wasn&rsquo;t until the year 2000 and beyond that it became clear, but the writing had been on the wall for a while.</p>

<h1>Pigeonholed</h1>
 <p>Kendell said words to the effect that young people are trapped by house payments, rent, and car payments. That made me sit up because it was another way of saying that the ecoomy is not working for anybody, but it particularly isn&rsquo;t working for the young. For my generation (<em>i.e.</em>, I was born in 1951) if you &ldquo;you studied hard&rsquo; and &ldquo;worked hard&rsquo;, you had a chance to do better than your parents. And indeed, that was the case for many of us (<em>i.e.</em>, white, lower middle-class). But that is not the case any more for the great majority of our young people. Achieving a modicum of that kind of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; takes a lot of 

 <p>Buckminster Fuller talked about making things lighter making your house lighter making your curl lighter and uh I don't know how he he meant that but subscriptions or any kind of temporary session is a way to make a letter so in Airbnb I own that house for a week or three days or a month or whatever it is but I don't have to carry all my furniture over there I have to carry all my stuff over there uh I know.</p>
