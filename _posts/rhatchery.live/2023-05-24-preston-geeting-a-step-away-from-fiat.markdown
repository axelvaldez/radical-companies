 <p>Small bites: support sales people to run their own businesses, without the need for an investment.</p>

<h1>Top Down?</h1>
 <p>Preston has been in the packaging business for a long time. All-his-working-life long. After many years in a big, stable, generous business, he decided to get out and start a company with a serial entreprenneur from Terra Icognita Australis, better known as Australia these days. Their business has grown big and fast in a mere four year.</p>
 <p>But what does have to do with getting away from <span class="_paradig">Fiat</span>. Not a whole lot, from one point of view. From another this could be a first <em>small bite</em></p>

<h1>No Top Down Management</h1>
 <p>What Preston calls Top-Down Management is the <span class="_paradig">Fiat</span> hierarchy. People at the bottom have to report on what they are doing to people at the top so that they feel they know what is going on. Preston said that they spend up to 90% of their time writing reports instead of getting in front of customers.</p>
 <p>Preston said <span class="_quotespan">they are the top and my partner and I are at the bottom,</span> Not necessarily the way I would have said, but definitely not <span class="_paradig">Fiat</span>. I commented that this could be the first step towards getting them to be autonomous.</p>
 </p>To me, that was a firm enough step away from <span class="_paradig">Fiat</span>. I did mantioned why not continue to Finance and the otehr administrative areas? Why not?</p>
 </p>Here is hoping.</p>
