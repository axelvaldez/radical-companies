 <p>&ldquo;Being aware&rdquo; is Andrew&rsquo;s term for <em>seeing</em> the damage that the <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> system does to people.</p>

<h1>Quite A Player</h1>
 <p>Andrew is preety quiet, but very persistant. He related the story of how he realized that being good to people was more important than productivity or any of traditional metrics.</p>
 <p>If you have to do what the boss wants, then you are boxed in. You can nibble at the edges, but the main thing is executing on what boss wants. This doesn't oten show up as brute force, more like <spane class="_quotespan">that&rsquo;s the way it works.</span> Opposite to that, Andrew found, is that playfulness is key to extraordinaty results. People who feel free to be playful also feel free to put their best ideas on the table. Others feel free to collaborate and play with it. That&rsquo;s how innovations happen.</p>
