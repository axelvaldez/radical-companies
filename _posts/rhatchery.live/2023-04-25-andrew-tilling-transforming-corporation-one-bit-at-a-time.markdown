<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>We had a very interesting podcast with Andrew Tilling who is helping big business transform to co-management.</p>
 <p>Andrew Tillings is a Brit living in Italy and he&rsquo;s the founder of The Hive Change Consultanty. The name comes from Andrew&rsquo;s admirations of bees who communicate complex patterns and choose a direction to go build a new hive by consent. Not all of the bees have to, and not all them do, but if enough of them follow, they can build a new hive. They don&rsquo;t follow the boss, because there isn&rsquo;t any, they follow what resonates with them. The decision is decentralized.</p>
 <p>Rather than trying to convert the whole business at once, Andrew goes about it in small bites. Sometime he&rsquo;ll start with Sales and show them how they can improve sales in a decentralized way. Bosses take time away from what they like to do most: selling. Bosses consume a big salary that is better applied to another sales person or resources to make them all more effective. The result is increase sales.</p>
 <p>He also shows them how transparency trumps made up bullshit. Being honest and straightforward with customers creates trust and pays in the end.</p>

<h1>Complement</h1>
 <p>The revelation for us was that Andrew&rsquo;s way could a complement to our efforts and his approach could be used to introduce co-ownership.</p>
 <p>For example, <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s can be introduced to the team and the &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; budget could be distributed according to them,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Introducing RADs would give them visceral experience of collaborating without a boss.</li>
   <li>The bonus distribution would make their decisions tangible.</li>
   <li>The whole thing would be transparent and the transparency would give them the ability to make corrections.</li>
   <li>In the end, it would feel fair, rather than having the boss pass out secret checks.</li>
  </ul>
