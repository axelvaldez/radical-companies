 <p>We had a very interesting podcast with Andrew Tilling who is helping big business transform to co-management.</p>
 <p>Andrew Tillings is a Brit living in Italy and he&rsquo;s the founder of The Hive Change Consultanty. The name comes from Andrew&rsquo;s admirations of bees who communicate complex patterns and choose a direction to go build a new hive by consent: not all the bees do, but if enough of them followe in the same direction, they can build a new hive. They don&rsquo;t follow the boss, because there isn&rsquo;t any, they follow what resonates with them. The decision is decentralized.</p>
 <p>Rather than trying to convert the whole business at one, Andrew goes about it in small bites. Sometime he&rsquo;ll start with Sales and show them how they can improve sales in a decentralized way. Bosses don&rsquo;t take time away from sellling, what they like to do most. Bosses consume a big salary that is better applied to another sales person or resources to make them more effective.</p>
 <p>He also shows them how transparency trumps bullshit. Being honest and straigtforward with customers creates trust and pays in the end.</p>
