 <p>For authors, bloggers, and podcasters, <span class='_paradigm'>rMARK!</span> is primarily a source of specific, actionable feedback about their content.</p>
</div>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/remark-buttons-vertical.svg"
   height="14em"
   style="float:left; padding-top:25px; padding-right; "
   alt="">
 </div> 
 <p>The rEmark! buttons are a floating button combo that readers can use to give feedback to authors. Clicking on the <code>plus</code> button records a positive response to specific text that readers highlight; the <code>minus</code> button indicates some form of dissatisfaction with a highlighted segment.</p>
 <p>Readers can leave comments for each fragment they click on. Other visitors to the site can choose to see all comments or not (<em>i.e.</em>, default is OFF).</p>

<h1>Value</h1>
 <p>For authors, bloggers, and podcasters rEmark! is primarily a source of specific, actionable feedback about their content. They get the highlighted passages, the number of positive and negative clicks, and comments associated with each.</p>

<h1>Feedback and Monetization</h1>
 <p>Clicks on the plus button are equivalent to plus-one-<span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> and clicks on the <code>minus</code> button are equivalent to minus-one-<<span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>. Authors will get the actual numbers for feedback. For monetization, any money available for distribution will get allocated according to the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s assigned to each segment (<em>i.e.</em>, but no less than zero).</p>
 <p>Any money that flows through the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s comes from funds that readers set up to support the blog sites they follow. Alternatively, a fund may be set up to support a pool of specific blog sites, or to support a particular topic.</p>
 <p>Any personal information provided by the user will be used to create the fund and then discarded, but before throwing it out we&rsquo;ll calculate an ID hash off it. We can later use this ID to associate the reader with the fund while users remain anonymous.</p>
 <p>For example, let&rsquo;s assume that,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Anita has set up a $10 fund to be distributed every week.</li>
   <li>Week 1, she gave <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to three blog posts.</li>
   <li>Week 2, she gave <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to five,</li>
  </ul>
 <p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if all the posts were written by one author or several: Post 1.3 gets $1.67 one week and Post 2.3 gets $1.00 the following week.</p>

      <li><em>Git</em> is a very popular software source control<a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> system. It allows software developers to work as peers, in parallel.</li>

      <li>Whenever I want to merge the code in my flow into the trunk, I create a pull request for the trunk&rsquo;s admin. We&rsquo;d have a discussion about my branch in the pull request and if everything lines up, the code in my branch is merged into the trunk.</li>

      <li>This is the wiki engine used by Wikipedia and it is friendly enough for writers. At least those who are used to Wiki Markup.<a href="#en05"><sup id="bm05">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></li>

      <li>It is Open Source.</li>

      <li>Authors can see each other&rsquo;s words appearing in the document as they work in parallel, as peers. They can also see each other&rsquo;s gestures (via the cursor).</li>

      <li>The code is proprietary. It supports a version of JavaScript that you can use to make extensions, but you&rsquo;re SOL if you want to make a major mod to it.</li>
      <li>Only one version is rendered at one time. If you want to work off the version from three days ago, you have to choose it for rendering. But this deprecates the current version. If three people modified the version you&rsquo;re interested in, you can render only one; the others are History.</li>

<h1>Another Thought</h1>
 <ul>
  <li><em>rEmark!</em> and <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> will probably share a backend.</li>
  <li>Later, provide a decentralized highlight and annotation service.</li>
 </ul>
