<h1>CCC Intro</h1>
 <img
  src="/assets/img/pic-remark-buttons-vertical.svg"
  height="14em"
  style="float:left; padding-top:25px; padding-right; "
  alt="At the top, two buttons enclosed is a box: a green button with a plus sign inside it and, below it, a red button with a minus sign inside it. Bellow the combo, a white button with 'comments ON' inside it. At the bottom a blue button with with 'comments OFF' inside it."

 <p>The rEmark! buttons are a floating button combo that readers can use to give feedback to authors. Clicking on the <code>plus</code> button records a positive response to specific text that readers highlight; the <code>minus</code> button indicates some form of dissatisfaction with a highlighted segment.</p>
 <p>Readers can leave comments for each fragment they click on. Other visitors to the site can choose to see all comments or not (<em>i.e.</em>, default is OFF).</p>

<h1>Value</h1>
 <p>For authors, bloggers, and podcasters rEmark! is primarily a source of specific, actionable feedback about their content. They get the highlighted passages, the number of positive and negative clicks, and comments associated with each.</p>

<h1>Feedback and Monetization</h1>
 <p>Clicks on the plus button are equivalent to plus-one-<span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> and clicks on the <code>minus</code> button are equivalent to minus-one-<<span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>. Authors will get the actual numbers for feedback. For monetization, any money available for distribution will get allocated according to the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s assigned to each segment (<em>i.e.</em>, but no less than zero).</p>
 <p>Any money that flows through the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s comes from funds that readers set up to support the blog sites they follow. Alternatively, a fund may be set up to support a pool of specific blog sites, or to support a particular topic.</p>
 <p>Any personal information provided by the user will be used to create the fund and then discarded, but before throwing it out we&rsquo;ll calculate an ID hash off it. We can later use this ID to associate the reader with the fund while users remain anonymous.</p>
 <p>For example, let&rsquo;s assume that,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Anita has set up a $10 fund to be distributed every week.</li>
   <li>Week 1, she gave <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to three blog posts.</li>
   <li>Week 2, she gave <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to five,</li>
  </ul>
 <p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if all the posts were written by one author or several: Post 1.3 gets $1.67 one week and Post 2.3 gets $1.00 the following week.</p>

<h1>Another Thought</h1>
 <ul>
  <li><em>rEmark!</em> and <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> will probably share a backend.</li>
  <li>Later, provide a decentralized highlight and annotation service.</li>
 </ul>
