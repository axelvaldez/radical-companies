 <p>Recognition is a form of reflection, not introspection.</p>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>A simple system to recognize contributions that others have made to me, to my team, or to my company.</p>
 
<h1>Making It Viral</h1>
 <p>Adding a non-<em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> person to my list will automatically generate an email to 1) let her know she&rsquo;s been added to my list, and 2) invite her to download the app and start to give out <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. This app will strengthen the users/co-owners as it spreads organically to other users/co-owners.</p>
 <p>Those who chose to not use the app—and therefore chose not to give <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s—will still receive them.</p>
 
<h1>Cycles</h1>
 <p>The system supports a periodic distribution cycle. People may get together and hold Distribution at different times. In other words, there is no &ldquo;correct&rdquo; or &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; cycle time that will apply to all. People can even switch from one cycle time to another as they wish.</p>
 <p>At the end of a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> Distribution, after all <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s have been allocated, a Global RESET command is broadcast to all people associated with a specific cycle time. For example, all the &ldquo;full moon&rdquo; people get together outside, under a full moon, allocate their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, have their retrospectives, along with food and drink and dance and whatever else they choose to do. At the end of it, their allocations are reset to the baseline.</p>

     <p>There is no hard criteria for this and could be any kind of contribution, whatever the user considers a valuable contribution (<em>e.g.</em>, number of checkins, a significant conversation).</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Keep track of people and Banners who are candidates for getting <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</li>
       <li>Keep track of people you need to give feedback to.</li>
       <li>Send your distribution at the end of the month.</li>

<h1>Other</h1>
 <p><em>RADs!</em> and <em>Remark!</em> will eventually share a backend. They will run on iOS, Android, Web.</p>
