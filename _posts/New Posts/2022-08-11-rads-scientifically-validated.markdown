 <p>Ten years of research say that RADs are right.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>In a Harvard Business Revue article, <span style="font-style:italic; "><em>The Neuroscience of Trust</em></span>, the author, Paul Zak, says that &ldquo;it’s clear that creating an employee-centric culture can be good for business.&rdquo;<a id="bm01" href="#en01"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></a> Employee-centric cultures, in turn, are based on trust and these are the eight behaviors that promote it,

   <td class="_list-item">
    <p>&ldquo;The neuroscience shows that recognition has the largest effect on trust when it occurs immediately after a goal has been met, when it comes from peers, and when it’s tangible, unexpected, personal, and public.&rdquo;</p>

   <td class="_list-item">
    <p>&ldquo;&hellip; allow them, whenever possible, to manage people and execute projects in their own way. Being trusted to figure things out is a big motivator.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Autonomy also promotes innovation&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

   </th>
   <td class="_list-item">
    <p>&ldquo;&hellip; at work we often get the message that we should focus on completing tasks, not on making friends. Neuroscience experiments by my lab show that when people intentionally build social ties at work, their performance improves.&rdquo;</p>

 </table>
 <p>He concludes that,
  <div class="_quotation">&hellip;those working in high-trust companies enjoyed their jobs 60% more, were 70% more aligned with their companies’ purpose, and felt 66% closer to their colleagues. &hellip; Compared with employees at low-trust organizations, the high-trust folks had 11% more empathy for their workmates, depersonalized them 41% less often, and experienced 40% less burnout from their work. They felt a greater sense of accomplishment, as well—41% more.</div>
