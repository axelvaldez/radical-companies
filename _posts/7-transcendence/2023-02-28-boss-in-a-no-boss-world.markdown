<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>What does a boss do in a no-boss world? After so many years of winning competitions&hellip; does he give up competition for collaboration. After counting on force to get things done for so long&hellip; WHAT?</p>
 <p>I guess the only thing ahead for the boss is to learn to not be boss and to treat the people around her like his peers. Not employees, but peer co-owners.</p>
 <p>No matter, the transition will be very, very difficult.</p>
