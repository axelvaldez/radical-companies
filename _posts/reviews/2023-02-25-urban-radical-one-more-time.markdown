 <p>An (imaginary) conversation with Tim Urban on the impact his book had on me.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>Below is the continuation of an (imaginary) conversation with Tim Urban on the impact his book, <em>What&rsquo;s Ours Problem: A Self&ndash;Help Book for Society</em><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>, had on me.</p>

<h1>Continuing&hellip;</h1>
 <div class="_speakera">Out of love. That is making me unomfortable and energized at the same time. Weirder still, I feel like drawing.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">And speaking of your drawings, I&rsquo;d like to tell what I found most impactful about the book using your drawings. OK?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Seems like you are going to do it anyways&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Our history illustrated as a 1,000-page book made me sit up and pay attention.</div>
  <div class="_center">

  </div>
 <div class="_speakerb">When I got to the ladder, I recognized the analysis and labeling that was coming and I got pretty excited. Then you came up with higher and primtive minds, genies and golems and&hellip; and&hellip; it was music to my ears. The high-rung and low-run quadrants were pure joy.</div>

  </div>
 <div class="_speakerb"> I was aware of the distinction between what&rsquo;s inside your head and what is expressed and I knew that spoken language was key to our humanity. But it was a forehead-slaping moment when I saw this illustration and how communication makes possible the emergence of, for example, social animals.</div>

 <div class="_speakerb">And, of course, your use of &lsquo;silence&rsquo;. Maybe it was this diagram,</div>
 <div class="_center">

 </div>
 <div class="_continueb">I am not sure why, but I jumped up from my bed and moved to the laptop where I am writing this stuff. More than anything else it was, I think, the &lsquo;TIMID&rsquo; column. The VOCAL column and PROFITEERS squeeze the TIMIDs by limiting speech to dictatorship-convenient-speech or else. That is what has been happening in Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela. This is also what happens in  businesses, with the bosses as essential to their immune system.</div>
 <div class="_continueb">Finally, towards the end of the book, this other image jumped at me because it illustrates the biggest problem we face in moving forward,</div>
