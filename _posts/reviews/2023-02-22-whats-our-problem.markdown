 <p>If human history were to be laid out as a 1,000-page book, we'd be on page 1,000 right now. What&rsquo;s on page 1,001?</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>In <em>What&rsquo;s Our Problem: A Self-Help Book for Societies</em>, Tim Burton, the author, uses a very clever illustration that lays out all of human history as a 1,000 page book. He then asks, <span class="_quotespan">if the catastrophes of page 1,000 [uncluding the two World Wars] were the most devasting yet, what does that mean about catastrophies in page 1,001?</span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">The jump in technology from page 1,000 to 1,001 should prove to be even more extreme that the jump from 999 to 1,000&mdash;maybe many times more so.</span><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> and this is why we need to get away from <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> real soon. We&rsquo;d better have a solid non-<span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> mindset when we get to page 1,001.</p>
