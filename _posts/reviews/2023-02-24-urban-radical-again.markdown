 <p>An (imaginary) conversation with Tim Urban on blind spots.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>Below is the continuation of an (imaginary) conversation with Tim Urban, this time on blind spots. Urban is the author of, <em>What&rsquo;s Ours Problem: A Self&ndash;Help Book for Society</em>,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>.</p>

<h1>Co&ndash;Management</h1>
 <div class="_speakerb">You have a blind spot that&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakera">&hellip; I have many&hellip;.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">&hellip; that may be, but you have one in particular that I know something about</div>
 <div class="_speakera">That sounds like fundamentalism to me, but let&rsquo;s hear it.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">In any case, your blind spot is around &lsquo;jobs&rsquo; and &lsquo;top companies.&rsquo; You take them as a given, something you mention in passing, as the grass on the side of the road. &lsquo;It is beautiful, ain&rsquo;t it. It&rsquo;s always been there. How can such a beautiful thing be part of the problem?.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">So, the grass is my blind spot?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">The &lsquo;jobs&rsquo; and &lsquo;top companies&rsquo; are.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">How so?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Because a big part of the problems that you point out and are so passionate about <span style="font-style:normal; ">spring out</span> of what we call <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses, the source of &lsquo;jobs&rsquo; and &lsquo;top companies.&rsquo;</div>
 <div class="_speakera">So, you don&rsquo;t like capitalism. Go on.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">I love capitalism, what I think is working against us is ownership. But more about that later&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_continueb">Getting back to the &lsquo;jobs&rsquo; and &lsquo;top companies&rsquo; thing, you describe in your book the case where professor Nancy Hopkins walked out of the talk that Larry Summers was giving as an Economist, not as Harvard president.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Right.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">That example rearranged things in my head&hellip; actually, <span style="font-style:normal; ">it lifted the fog in my head</span> and I thank you for that.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I am glad!</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">As I was reading it, I realized what speaking out of love was all about.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I am still glad, but I don&rsquo;t get the connection.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">You make the distinction that Summers was invited to speak as an economist, not as Harvard president, but I think you know that it&rsquo;s very difficult to separate the two. I think you also know that it is even more difficult for Summers to not let his <span style="font-style:normal; ">hypotheses</span> as an Economist influence his decisions as Harvard president, even assumig that he is exceptionally good at doing so. If Hopsinks was thinking along those line, the perceived collusion probably was what was making Hopkins&rsquo; head explode. She could have behaved differently. She should have voiced her concern and Summers <span style="font-style:normal; ">and the rest of attendants</span> might have learned something.</div>
 <div class="_continueb">I tend to do what Hopkinds did. I don&rsquo;t say anything and walk out on talks that sound absurd to me. They leave out a piece that is obvious to me and after a but I am out of there. Thanks to the example in the book I am commmited to not be silent anymore and state whatever is <span style="font-style:normal; ">obvious to me</span> out of love for the speaker <span style="font-style:normal; ">and the audience</span>. I know that there&rsquo;d be consequences of doing that.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">OK, I stopped smiling and I think I am ready for the blind spot.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">You don&rsquo;t seem to see <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses; I think they are invisible to you. And you don&rsquo;t realize what a big and fundamental part of the problem they are. You illustrate the problem so well, but you don&rsquo;t see <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses as a source of it.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Thank you. I think.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">And you have not even asked me what a <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses is!</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I think I know what that is. I had not thought of <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> as a label, but I do recognize putting labels on things that have been invisible. Besides, you are going to tell me anyway.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Yes. I want to make sure we are starting from the same place. <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> means roughly &lsquo;because I say so&rsquo;. So, what you call Social Justice Fundamentalists I might call <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> Social Justice. Good, you are smiling again.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">It even is a nice smile and not a &lsquo;how stupid do you believe me to be?&rsquo; smile.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">In any case, we realized that the way businesses are organized is by <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>. The owners control what goes on through their <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> hierarchy. And the owners get that power over everything through their capital. The alternative RADICAL companies that we we are proposing, and actively making happen, are based on contributions. Wait&hellip; that was a jump&hellip; </div>
 <div class="_speakera">That&rsquo;s OK. Labels are useful for illuminating distictions and calling some companies <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> created the space for other companies, in this case <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies. Nice.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Thank you. I will continue with my slow version of this story to make sure we don't off to different assumptions. For example, we always say <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> <<span style="font-style:normal; ">>business</span> and <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> <span style="font-style:normal; ">companies</span>.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">OK. Got it. The full lables are: <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> business and <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies. <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> business have been invisible, and that is correct. And, I assume that <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies don't exist but would be complementary to the arguments I put forward in <span class="_me">What&rsquo;s Our Problem</span>.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Bingo! The most dangerous thing about <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses is that they have been invisible. They also teach us that capital measn unquestionable power. Capital gives you absolute power over everything that goes on inside a business. And that why we call businesses dictatorships.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I because you are from Cuba, you know about dictatorships.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">I thought I knew, but I know a lot more now thank to you. Your book as provided me with actionable knowledge. Silence lets Fundamentalism gain strength. This is how dictatorships start, where they spring from. We keep silent to get along and in the blink of an eye, we <span class="_speakerb">have to</span> keep silent to stay unhurt and alive.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Yes!</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">And <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses are silence-training camps. And <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> schools and homes, that learned from <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses. We pride ourselves on being good citizens of democracies by supporting <span class="_speakerb">dictatorships</span> known as <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">And they have been so successful&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">&hellip; financially successful!&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Yes, but more that that. They have also been successful in paying off a portion of society who then becomes an essential part of their <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> immunne system. The middle class is essential to the immune system of the the dictatorship golem. Shit.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Shit, indeed. I could not have put that better.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Except, you just did.</div>
