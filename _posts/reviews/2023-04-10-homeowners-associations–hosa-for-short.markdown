 <p>Homeowners associations&mdash;HOAs for short&mdash;are private organizations that oversee the management of residential communities. And they are good example of a move towards centralization and away from transparency. In a lot of ways, HOAs are are reminiscent of enclosures.</p>

 <p class="">An ideologically mediated contest between production incommon and expropriation of the common. On the one hand, it is possible to locate a ‘positive’moment of the increasing socialization of work through which production has become social andcooperative, involving production from the common, in common, of the common. On the otherhand, there is a ‘negative’ moment that seeks to separate, enclose and capture this common.Entrepreneurship is a key ideological operator in the expropriation of the common, throughlocalizing production and claims to value in one particular element of socialized production.Although entrepreneurship research today recognizes that entrepreneurship rests on productionin common, it hesitates to come to the radical conclusions required by this recognition. Caughtbetween production in common and expropriation of the common, entrepreneurship andentrepreneurship research today confront the prospect that those whose production in commonis daily expropriated might turn the tables on the expropriators.</span>
