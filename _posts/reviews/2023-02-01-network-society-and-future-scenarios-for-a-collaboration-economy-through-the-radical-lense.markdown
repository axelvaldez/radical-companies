 <p>The book came really, really close, but it doesn&rsquo;t quite get to something like <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, although the authors point out the need for something like that.</p>

<h1>A Short Review</h1>
 <p>I got pretty excited to read this book because it sounded like they had arrived at the same conclusion that we had <em>eight years earlier</em>. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t quite what I had hoped. The book came really, really close, but no cigar. Nonetheless, the authors do recognize the need for something like <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>
 <p>Their view from a different perspective, from <em>Neo-Feudal Cognitive Capitalism</em> to <em>Mature Peer Production</em>. One of the authors is the founder of the <em>P2P Foundation</em> and the book calls people &ldquo;peers.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>The Commons</h1>
 <p class="_citation">&hellip; the Commons is an idea different both from state property, where the sate manages a certain resource on behalf of people, and from private property, where a private entity exclusde the common use of it.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>They then add this, which they attribute to Siobhain O'Mahony,</p>
 <p class="_citation">It is, however, important to highlight that the contributors of CBPP<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> projects do have interest and rights concerning their work and are interested in protecting their intellectual property.</p>
 <p>With <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s people could get a patent and then distribut the revenue that comes from it based on the recognized contributions (to the project) each person has.</p>

<h1>Recommendation: Read It!</h1>
 <p>The book is short, but not an easy read. No.</p>
 <p>While reading it, it felt I was being lectured. The book relies on a lot of obscure terms (<em>e.g.</em> stigmergic) and lots of abbreviations (<em>e.g.</em>, TEP, ICT, CBPP).</p>
 <p>Having said all this, I still recommend you reading it. Not because misery loves company, but because they give extensive references and make a formal case for co-ownership and co-management.</p>
 <p>I suspect that we would be well aligned with the authors.</p>
