<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Homeowners Associations (HOAs) are private organizations that manage residential communities. They are also good example of increase centralization and reduced transparency.</p>
 <p>Reminds me of the different between collaboration and cooperation.<p>
 <div class="_citation">
  Collaboration and cooperation are close, but not the same. They are both about working with others, but,
  <ul>
   <li>Collaboration aims <em>to achieve shared goals</em>.</li>
   <li>Cooperation aims <em>to achieve your own goals</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  Cooperation is what the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> ownership imposes via capital. Collaboration, on the other hand, is part of our evolution. And we still do it naturally today via contributions to our community.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>
 </div>

<h1>Increased Centralization</h1>
 <p>The local government is already more centralized than what we need today. Moving a development from the public sphere to the private sphere makes it even more centralized. Private businesses are the sacred cows in our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> society and they have all the characteristics of dictatorships,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The are in the private sphere.</li>
   <li>They are secretive and opaque to the outside.</li>
   <li>They rule by FIAt.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Reduced Transparency</h1>
 <p>The move to the HOA makes everything opaque, as provided by law. Period.</p>

<h1>But It Is <em>Cheaper</em></h1>
 <p>The justification for doing this is that it cheaper. Besides receiving a fee for allowing the HOA, the local government takes the developmen&rsquo;s roads and other bothers off their books. If homeowners are abused or exploited, well they should not have bought a house in that developement. Never mind that our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> society shapes and pressures people to &ldquo;go up in life&rdquo; and the development was their way to buy a house.</p>
 <p>No matter, it is cheaper for the local government and that&rsquo;s all that counts in <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> land.</p>
