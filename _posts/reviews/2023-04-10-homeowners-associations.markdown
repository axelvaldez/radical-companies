 <p>Reminds me of the different between collaboration and cooperation.<p>
 <div class="_citation">
  Collaboration and cooperation are close, but not the same. They are both about working with others, but,
  <ul>
   <li>Collaboration aims <em>to achieve shared goals</em>.</li>
   <li>Cooperation aims <em>to achieve your own goals</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  Cooperation is what the <span class='_paragigm'>FIAT</span> ownership imposes via capital. Collaboration, on the other hand, is what people have done throughout evolution and still do today via contributions.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>
