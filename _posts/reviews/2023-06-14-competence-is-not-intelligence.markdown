 <p>Intelligence is what comes to us as conscious throught; competence is how we digest food, go to the bathroom, etc. We don&rsquo;t know how we do it, it just happens.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Blair Fix makes an excellent post in his latest post: competence is not intelligence.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Intelligence is what comes to us as conscious thought. Digesting food, going to the bathroom. That is competence, but we don&rsquo;t know how we do it. It just happens. We will know <em>exactly</em> now it works one day, but we have been doing for a long time without knowing how it happens.</p>
 <p>It isn&rsquo;t Artificial Intelligence that is going to <span class='_quotespan'>eliminate humanity.</span> The high risk for us is the enclosures of Artificial Competence technology, tools.</p>
 <p>If the Musks and Altmans of this world have it their way, their businesses will among the handful who will be allowed to build Articial Competence tools. Smaller companies will have to take a lot of <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> investment to get over the regulatory hump or stay out of that business altogether.</p>
 <p>Open Source Software (OSS) wil be out of it for good.</p>

<h1>The Real Risk</h1>
 <p>These enclosures are the real risk. And it is not the fact that somebody will be making more money our ot it. The real risk is that by virtue of their capital investements they will getting more power to do their own &ldquo;regulation.&rdquo;.</p>
 <p>A few people will be slotted into the priviledged category of &ldquo;AI wizards&rdquo; and be paid a &ldquo;reasonable.&rdquo; amount, enough to make them think they are different. Everybody else will live off handouts from the <em>21c Robber Barons</em>. This means that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and the oligarchic owners will continue to thrive and the possibility of non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> systems and co-ownership will be slowed down.</p>
 <p>The piece by Blair Fix is entitled, <span class='_quotespan'>No, AI Does Not Pose an Existential Risk to Humanity</span>. It is very true. A,so, very true is that the <em>21c Robbert Barons</em> are pushing hard for an enclosure-by-regulation moat around their businesses.</p>
