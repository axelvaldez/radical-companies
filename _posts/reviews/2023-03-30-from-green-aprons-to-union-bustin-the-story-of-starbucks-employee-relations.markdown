 <p>Starbucks shows why co-management is not enough. We need to get away from ownership based on capital to co-onwership based on contributions.</p>

<h1>Sad</h1>
 <p>This makes me sad because once upon a time, Starbucks was the good, generous employer. The thing that got the most press is that they paid for health  insurance for part-time baristas. This shows why co-management is not enough. We need to get away from ownership based on capital to co-onwership based on contributions.</p>

<h1>Starbucks Green Apron Book</h1>
 <p>They even had a <em>Starbucks Green Apron Book</em>,<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>The Starbucks Green Apron Book is one of the first things a new Barista gets when they start their job at Starbucks. &hellip; The book is full of great insights into how the company works and how customers should be handled each and ever day. &hellip; Some pages tell of how to get involved in the company, be knowledgeable about the coffee, create a great working environment and what a customer should expect from their Starbucks experience when they enter any store. &hellip; [It] outlines the legendary service Howard Schultz created when making Starbucks what it is today.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Be knowledgeable.</li>
     <li>Love what you do, share it with others.</li>
     <li>Be involved. In the store, in the company, in the community.</li>
     <li>Our Values: Passion for everything we do. Integrity. Entrepreneurial spirit and drive. Pride and success. Respect for our partners.</li>
     <li>Our Purpose: To provide an uplifting experience that enriches people’s daily lives.</li>
     <li>Be Welcoming:</li>
      <ul>
       <li>Greet customers as they walk through the door.</li>
       <li>Start a conversation.</li>
       <li>Get to know customers drinks and names.</li>
       <li>Ensure that the customer is the number one priority.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

<h1>Very Different Today</h1>
 <p>Since then Starbucks became one of the worst employeers around. This is what <a href="https://sfba.social/@shansterable@c.im" target="_blank">@shansterable@c.im</a> posted this in <span class="_bolder">Mastodon</span>&rsquo;s <a href="https://sfba.social/home" target="_blank">sfba.social</a> today,</p>

  <p>Howard Schultz’s own family foundation says Starbucks is near the bottom of food and retail employers with respect to how it treats its workers.” In a study of America’s 250 largest companies, funded in part by the Schultz Family Foundation:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Starbucks received the lowest possible rating on its pay and frequency of internal promotion</li>
    <li>Of the 11 food and retail companies studied, Starbucks ranked second to last regarding pay, promotions, and retention &ndash; worse than Dollar Tree, Walmart, Dollar General, and Kroger and just slightly better than McDonald&rsquo;s</li>
   </ul>
  <p>Starbucks has engaged in the most significant union-busting campaign in modern history. It has been led by Howard Schultz, the company’s founder and 3-time CEO, who is synonymous with the brand.</p>
  <p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has more than 500 pending cases against Starbucks and NLRB judges have found Starbucks has violated the law over 100 times.</p>
  <p>According to a March 27, 2023, <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/No-Company-is-Above-the-Law-HELP-Report.pdf" target="_blank">US Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP) report</a>.</p>

 <p>This shows that co-management <em>is not enough</em>. It is inspirational and values and purpose sound good: you really want to believe it! But whether they apply or not, it is up to the owners. And when a business like Starbucks focus on the financial bottom line. As it happened in Starbuck&rsquo;, the owners can decide to ignore values, purpose, and all the rest and focus on the financial goal. Starbucks is not the first one to go from &ldquo;good&rdquo;  emloyer to &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the margin&rdquo; employer.</p>
 <p>We need to get away from ownership based on capital and towards decentralized ownership based on contributions. Co-owners will not go against themselves.</p>
