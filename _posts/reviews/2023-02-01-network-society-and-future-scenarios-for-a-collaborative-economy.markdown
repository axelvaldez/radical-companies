 <p>The book came really, really close, but it doesn&rsquo;t quite get to something like <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, although the authors point out the need for something like them.</p>

<h1>A Short Review</h1>
 <p>I got pretty excited to read this book because it sounded like they had arrived at a conclusion similar to ours, and they had done <em>eight years earlier</em>. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t quite what I had hoped. The book came really, really close, but no cigar. Nonetheless, the authors do recognize the need for something like <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>
 <p>Their view from a different perspective, the see three models competing for power: traditional capitalism, neo-feudal cognitive capitalism, and  Commons-based  peer  production. Their favorite is the latter,</p>

<h1>The Commons</h1>
 <p class="_citation">&hellip; the Commons is an idea different both from state property &hellip; and from private property&hellip;<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>They then add this, which they attribute to Siobhain O'Mahony,</p>
 <p class="_citation">It is, however, important to highlight that the contributors of CBPP<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> projects do have interest and rights concerning their work and are interested in protecting their intellectual property.</p>
 <p>With <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, people could get a patent and then distribute the revenue that comes from it based on the recognized contributions (to the patent project) each person has.</p>

<h1>Not Sure What to Call this&hellip;</h1>
 The authors posit that the &ldquo;partner state&rdquo; would engage <p class="_citation">in debt-free public monetary creation while supporting a structure of specialized complementary currencies.</p>
 <p>All I can say is &rdquo;maybe for a bit.&rdquo; My quesion is how to create such a &ldquo;partner state?&rdquo; Put another way, what would the system be that would bring anything like this &ldquo;partner state?&rdquo; about? What would the system be that makes this robust and long lasting?
 <p>The book is full of these. Maybe if I read it again, more carefully&hellip; ? But no, not worth it.</p>

<h1>Recommendation</h1>
 <p>The book is short, but not an easy read. While reading it, it felt I was being lectured. The book relies on obscure terms and lots of abbreviations, and, what sounds to me, gibberish. Like I said, it is not an easy read.</p>
 <p>Read it at your own risk. It includes a lot of references. This may make it worth $65 to you. If you want my copy, please let me know and we'll figure out a way to give you mine (Kindle).</p>
