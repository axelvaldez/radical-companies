“Howard Schultz’s own family foundation says Starbucks is near the bottom of food and retail employers with respect to how it treats its workers.” In a study of America’s 250 largest companies, funded in part by the Schultz Family Foundation:  

- Starbucks received the lowest possible rating on its pay and frequency of internal promotion
- Of the 11 food and retail companies studied, Starbucks ranked second to last regarding pay, promotions, and retention – worse than Dollar Tree, Walmart, Dollar General, and Kroger and just slightly better than McDonald’s

“Starbucks has engaged in the most significant union-busting campaign in modern history. It has been led by Howard Schultz, the company’s founder and 3-time CEO, who is synonymous with the brand.” 

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has more than 500 pending cases against Starbucks and NLRB judges have found Starbucks has violated the law over 100 times.

According to a March 27, 2023, US Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP) report.
