<h1>Na&iuml;ve Summary</h1>
 <p>The author, Blair Fix, comes to the conclusion that, <span class="_quotespan">Hierarchies are perhaps the dominant feature of our working lives. Yet paradoxically, they rarely enter into mainstream theories of income distribution.</span></p>
 <p>Unfortumately, <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; the study of income distribution became dominated by human capital theory , which focused on personal traits and neglected &lsquo;structural&rsquo; explanations of income.</span>

 <h1>Hierarchical Power</h1>
 <p>He introduces <span class="_quotespan">hierarchical power</span> as <span class="_quotespan">1 + number of subordinates</span>.</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  <span class="_quotespan">&hellip;The rich get richer in a highly uniform way,</span>
  <span class="_quotespan">To summarize the evidence thus far, we know the following,</span>
  <ol>
   <li>The United States has grown more unequal over the last 4 decades</li>
   <li>This growing inequality occurred via a ‘fattening’ of the income distribution tail</li>
   <li>Growing inequality is associated with a dramatic increase in US CEO pay</li>
   <li>Like the redistribution of top incomes, the pay increases of US CEOs has an underlying uniformity: the rate at which income scales with hierarchical power seems to have increased</li>
   <li>This increasing ‘hierarchical despotism’ among US CEOs correlates with rising US inequality (Fig. 10), suggesting that US hierarchies have become more despotic.</li>
  </ol>
 </div>
 <p>He then goes to demostrates that it is not only the US, but this is happening in the richest countries of the world.</p>
 <span class="_quotespan">The evidence strongly hints that hierarchy lies at the root of US income redistribution.</span>
 <span class="_quotespan">The reason top incomes follow a uniform pattern, I have argued, is not because income has an ultimately simple cause. Instead, it is because the complex forces that shape income pass through a ubiquitous feature of human organization: hierarchy.</spane>
