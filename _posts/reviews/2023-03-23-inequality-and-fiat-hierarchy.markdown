<h1>Na&iuml;ve Summary</h1>
 <p>The author, Blair Fix, comes to the conclusion that, <span class="_quotespan">Hierarchies are perhaps the dominant feature of our working lives. Yet paradoxically, they rarely enter into mainstream theories of income distribution.</span></p>
 <p>Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t take long before <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; the study of income distribution became dominated by human capital theory , which focused on personal traits and neglected &lsquo;structural&rsquo; explanations of income.</span>

<h1>Hierarchical Power</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <ol>
   <li>The United States has grown more unequal over the last 4 decades</li>
   <li>This growing inequality occurred via a ‘fattening’ of the income distribution tail</li>
   <li>Growing inequality is associated with a dramatic increase in US CEO pay</li>
   <li>Like the redistribution of top incomes, the pay increases of US CEOs has an underlying uniformity: the rate at which income scales with hierarchical power seems to have increased</li>
   <li>This increasing ‘hierarchical despotism’ among US CEOs correlates with rising US inequality (Fig. 10), suggesting that US hierarchies have become more despotic.</li>
  </ol>
 </div>
 <p>The same is true throughout the world, not just in the  US.</p>

<h1>Despotism</h1>
  <div class="_citation">
   <span class="_quotespan">Importantly, despotism is not just a game for rulers. It is a game played by everyone in the hierarchy . The result, I propose, is that the more despotic the hierarchy becomes, the more rapidly income will increase with hierarchical power. It makes sense, then, to use the scaling of income with hierarchical power, D, as a measure of the &lsquo;degree of hierarchical despotism.&rsquo;</span>
  <p><span class="_quotespan">The greater the value of <em>D</em>,</span> he says, <span class="_quotespan">the more despotic the hierarchy</span>.</p>
   <div class="_center">
    <span>relative income <span style="font-size:x-large; ">&#x221D;</span> hierarchical power<sup>D</sup></span>
   </div>
  </div>
  <p><em>D</em> represents hierarchical power, a measure of the &ldquo;degree of hierarchical despotism.&rdquo; The word <em>despotism</em> is used in <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; as in the abuse of power</span>. <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; they concentrate power at the top &ndash; a feature that inevitably creates problems. Yes, rulers can use their power to benefit the group. But they can also use their power to enrich themselves. The more they do so, the more &lsquo;despotic&rsquo; the hierarchy.</span></p>
  <p>Of course, from our perspective, the &lsquo;depotic&rsquo; element is common of <em>all</em> <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchies, and all businesses hierarchies are <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchies.</p>

But they can also use their power to enrich themselves.</span> Therefore, <span class="_quotespan">the more they do so, the more &lsquo;despotic&rsquo; the hierarchy</span>.</p>

 <p>He shows that, <span class="_quotespan">hierarchy lies at the root of US income redistribution,</span> &hellip; <span class="_quotespan">growing inequality is caused by a redistribution of income within hierarchies.</span></p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <span class="_quotespan">The reason top incomes follow a uniform pattern&hellip; is not because income has an ultimately simple cause. Instead, it is because the complex forces that shape income pass through a ubiquitous feature of human organization: hierarchy.</span>

  <p>Here is a graphics that illustrates how as <em>span of control</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, hierachical despotism) decreases, the <em>top of 1% income</em> increases,</p>
