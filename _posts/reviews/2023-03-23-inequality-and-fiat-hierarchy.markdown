<h1>My Summary</h1>
 <p>The author of <em>Redistributing Income Through Hierarchy</em>,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Blair Fix, comes to the conclusion that, <span class="_quotespan">Hierarchies are perhaps the dominant feature of our working lives. Yet paradoxically, they rarely enter into mainstream theories of income distribution.</span> Unfortunately, <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; the study of income distribution became dominated by human capital theory , which focused on personal traits and neglected &lsquo;structural&rsquo; explanations of income.</span>

<h1>Hierarchical Power</h1>
 <p>A few facts,</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  <ol>
   <li>The United States has grown more unequal over the last 4 decades</li>
   <li>This growing inequality occurred via a ‘fattening’ of the income distribution tail</li>
   <li>Growing inequality is associated with a dramatic increase in US CEO pay</li>
   <li>&hellip; the pay increases of US CEOs has an underlying uniformity &hellip; [it] seems to have increased</li>
   <li>This increasing ‘hierarchical despotism’ among US CEOs correlates with rising US inequality &hellip; US hierarchies have become more despotic.</li>
  </ol>
 </div>
 <p>And the same is true throughout the world, not just in the  US.</p>

<h1>Despotism</h1>
  <p>Below, <em>D</em> represents hierarchical power or despotism. In other words, <span class="_quotespan">the greater the value of <span class="__me">D</span>, the more despotic the hierarchy.</span></p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <span style="font-style:italic; ">&hellip; despotism is not just a game for rulers. It is a game played by everyone in the hierarchy &hellip; the more despotic the hierarchy becomes, the more rapidly income will increase with hierarchical power.
    <div class="_center">
     <span>Relative Income <span style="font-size:x-large; ">&#x221D;</span> Hierarchical Power<sup>D</sup></span>
    </div>
   </span>
  </div>
  <p>The word <em>despotism</em> is used to indicates that,
   <ul>
    <li>Hierarchies <span class="_quotespan">concentrate power at the top</span></li>
    <li><span class="_quotespan">Rulers can use their power to benefit the group. But they can also use their power to enrich themselves</span></li>
    <li><span class="_quotespan">The more [rulers enrich themselves], the more &lsquo;despotic&rsquo; the hierarchy.</span></li>
   </ul>
  <p>From our perspective,</p>
   <ul>
    <li><em>Despotism is common of <span id="_bolder">all</span>  hierarchies</em></li>
    <li>Businesses hierarchies are  hierarchies.</li>
    <li>Modern governments are  hierarchies.</li>
   </ul>

<h1>() Hierarchy</h1>
  <div class="_citation">
   <span class="_quotespan">The reason top incomes follow a uniform pattern&hellip; is not because income has an ultimately simple cause. Instead, it is because the complex forces that shape income pass through a ubiquitous feature of human organization: hierarchy.</span>

<h1>Like Water to Fish</h1>
  <p> hierarchy is not only <span class="_quotespan">a ubiquitous feature of human organization,</span> it is the only system we can <em>think</em> of. All &ldquo;revolutions&rdquo; have been but variations of it.<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
  <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> system is an alternative,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Meaning and belonging (people) are at the root of it.</li>
    <li>All forms of organizations are decentralied and transparent.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></li>
