<h1>My Summary</h1>
 <p>The author, Blair Fix, comes to the conclusion that, <span class="_quotespan">Hierarchies are perhaps the dominant feature of our working lives. Yet paradoxically, they rarely enter into mainstream theories of income distribution.</span> Unfortunately, <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; the study of income distribution became dominated by human capital theory , which focused on personal traits and neglected &lsquo;structural&rsquo; explanations of income.</span>

<h1>Hierarchical Power</h1>
 <p>A few facts,</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  <ol>
   <li>The United States has grown more unequal over the last 4 decades</li>
   <li>This growing inequality occurred via a ‘fattening’ of the income distribution tail</li>
   <li>Growing inequality is associated with a dramatic increase in US CEO pay</li>
   <li>Like the redistribution of top incomes, the pay increases of US CEOs has an underlying uniformity: the rate at which income scales with hierarchical power seems to have increased</li>
   <li>This increasing ‘hierarchical despotism’ among US CEOs correlates with rising US inequality, suggesting that US hierarchies have become more despotic.</li>
  </ol>
 </div>
 <p>And the same is true throughout the world, not just in the  US.</p>

<h1>Despotism</h1>
  <p><em>D</em> represents hierarchical power, a measure of the &lsquo;degree of hierarchical despotism.&rsquo; In other words, <span class="_quotespan">the greater the value of <span class="__me">D</span>, the more despotic the hierarchy.</span></p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <span style="font-style:italic; ">Importantly, despotism is not just a game for rulers. It is a game played by everyone in the hierarchy . The result &hellip; is that the more despotic the hierarchy becomes, the more rapidly income will increase with hierarchical power.
    <div class="_center">
     <span>relative income <span style="font-size:x-large; ">&#x221D;</span> hierarchical power<sup>D</sup></span>
    </div>
   </span>
  </div>
  <p>The word <em>despotism</em>, in this context, indicates that,
   <ul>
    <li><span class="_quotespan">[<span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchies] concentrate power at the top</span></li>
    <li><span class="_quotespan">Rulers can use their power to benefit the group. But they can also use their power to enrich themselves</span></li>
    <li><span class="_quotespan">The more they [enrich themselves], the more &lsquo;despotic&rsquo; the hierarchy.</span></li>
   </ul>
  <p>Of course, from our perspective, the &lsquo;depotic&rsquo; element is common of <em>all</em> <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchies, and all businesses hierarchies are <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchies.</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <span class="_quotespan">The reason top incomes follow a uniform pattern&hellip; is not because income has an ultimately simple cause. Instead, it is because the complex forces that shape income pass through a ubiquitous feature of human organization: <span class="_me">[<span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>]</span> hierarchy.</span>
