 <p>Lead with <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> benefits, rather than <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span>&rsquo;s bad features. That was Jose suggestios for future posts, like this one.</p>

<h1><span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> Features</h1>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_foundation">
   <tr>
    <th>Co-Ownership</th>
    <td>
     <p>As a co-owner, you are no longer exchanging your time and skills for a wage. You are one of many owners and have rights to earned dividends, the wealth, that the company creates.</p>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s</th>
    <td>You give <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s to other co-owners, and they give you <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s. The <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you have determine how much of the earned dividends, the wealth the company has created you get</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th><span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL Foundation</span></th>
    <td>
     <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL Foundation</span> is the foundation for everything in the <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> world. It doesn&rsquo;t tell you what to do, but where you are heading.</p>
     <p>Will this decision make the company more or less decentralized?</p>
     <p>Will it make it more or less transparent?</p>
     <p>Will it get in the way of people finding meaning?</p>
     <p>Will it go against a co-owner&rsquo;s sense of beloging?</p>
     <p>Will it make it harder to experiment?</p>
    </td>
   </tr>
  </table>
