 <p>According to the post by Dr. John Roth, the Roman Emperor Tiberius was a good person when he was young, but he ended up “a debauched, dissolute, and cruel recluse.”</p>
  <div class="_citation">I have come to view Tiberius as a tragic figure, a good man, a gifted commander and leader, who was blindsided by multiple betrayals.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></div>
 <p>In <em>Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character</em> (Touchstone, New York, 1994), the author, Dr Jonathan Shay concludes that Achilles “suffered from a ruinous moral injury that destroys the character of once good men.”</p>
 <p>According to these authors, Achilles and Tiberius suffered from a basic distrust of their environment because of a trauma, like multiple betrayals, and their behavior reflected the kind of pain that goes under the label of PTSD.</p>
 <p>According to the Mayo Clinic, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is,</p>
  <div class="_citation">&hellip; a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event &ndash; either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.</div>
 <p>Not everyone develops PTSD from the same event. Two people can be in the same car accident and one will walk away temporarily shaken, and another may never want to get into a car again. An additional aspect of PTSD is chronic stress, like the amount of vigilance a soldier may have to undergo day in and day out. They may not experience one specific terrifying event, but many smaller calls to worry about survival may induce damage.</p>

<h1>Reaching&hellip;</h1>
 <p>Dr Shay and Dr. Roth reached into the past and concluded that what are normally portrayed as <span class="_quotespan">bad people</span> are people suffering from trauma. </p>
 <p>Back in the present, the questions are,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>How many people today are walking around with work-induced PTSD?</li>
   <li>Is society suffering from PTSD?</li>
  </ul>
 <p>After all, workplaces are where people spend most of their waking hours. Workplaces are where drama happens, oftentimes harmful drama that causes trauma.</p>
 <p>I am reminded of a friend&rsquo;s recent story about layoffs. He had survived layoffs, where a third of his team disappeared. This was sad enough because some of those people were not just his friends, but in his view, competent and undeserving of a layoff. Plus there was also <span class="_quotespan">survivor&rsquo;s guilt.</span> There were rumors of aother layoffs: the Sword of Damocles had been dangling over his head for months, taking its toll. Would he be fired? Would he, again, see people he had strong bonds with suffer?</p>
 <p>We have learned to <span class="_quotespan">man up</span> and <span class="_quotespan">don&rsquo;t say anything</span> when hurt. After all, <span class="_quotespan">it’s not personal, it’s just business.</span> We try to put away or ignore the pain, instead of facing it and dealing with the <em>very personal</em> harm that just happened to us.</p>

<h1>Trauma</h1>
 <p>Here is our starting point: <span class="_quotespan">Business encourages competition, and competition leads to trauma.</span> Ans some of this trauma ends up as PTSD.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> (<span class="_quotespan">because I say so</span>) system encourages competition and domination. It also encourages helplessness, another key component of PTSD. A terrifying event is even more harmful when you can do nothing to stop or diminish it. And <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> is the very definition of helplessness. This is built into structure of <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses. Top bosses compete. Lesser bosses compete. Wanna-be bosses compete. People compete for resources to do their jobs.</p>
 <p>The winners end on top and get to dominate the losers. They get not only higher status, they also get to extract more money for themselves. Their  voice becomes more dominant as their place in the FIAT hierarchy goes up. The whole <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy works that way.</p>
 <p>And, as it turns out, that is <em>not natural</em>.</p>

<h1>Human Capital</h1>
 <p>Capital can be seen as the right to deny access or control. Capital comes from, <em>capita,</em> capa, the head of a cow. A cow in a herd that you have control over, that you can decide how it is used, when it is sold, etc.</p>
 <p>It is your property, and by virtue of that you can deny others the use of it. It is <em>your</em> herd. That is the essence of <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> capital: the right to deny.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> structures of hierarchy capitalize people. A boss, in his competition for position in the hierarchy, acquires the right to deny the use of his team. Another boss can not just step in and tell the team what to do unless they are higher up in the pyramid. And it is not just about resource denial across teams.</p>
 <p>Compete-win-dominate works on <span class="_quotespan">them people,</span> those dissimilar to us. Once upon a time we could have been excused to think and act that way, but not anymore. Now we know that people the world over are similar. What separates us is the rationalized prejudices, stories, in our minds.</p>
 <p>The same resource denial points inward to the team itself. A boss can tell you how to do your job. They have the right to invalidate your own judgment.</p>
 <p>That <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> power that capitalizes your time is theoretically limited to your work. We, fortunately, do not capitalize humans in total anymore. But where do you spend the majority of your day? Does your worry about your work end when you leave your workplace or does it follow you home and through your cell phone? Does it follow up through looming changes that can come at a moment&rsquo;s notice?</p>
 <p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
 <p>Where once the owner was the source of punishment, today the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system itself does the dirty job by encouraging competition. Collaboration is what happens when a boss is not watching.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system parcels out motivation in the form of money, primarily. But, money is a form of force. And when coupled with other stories, it gets a grip on people: the dream car, the perfect house, at the perfect location, the bottomless bank account. Combined with these stories, money may not be as direct as corporal punishments, but it is a very effective force, indeed.</p>

<h1>PTSD</h1>
 <p>Businesses encourage the money-focused mindset and people-as-employees give up a lot in the process. Employees stop taking care of themselves, they give up dignity, they surrender their relationships.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system parcels out motivation in the form of money, primarily. But, money is a form of force. And when coupled with other stories, it getMy father took his work well beyond the office in order to succeed in the corporate FIAT structure. He was promoted many times and controlled important territories within the company. But he also brought home to his family the refusal to listen of his boss training. As with boss to employee, the relationship of father to child was mainly one way, with occasional lucky interactions of two way communication. And when I refused to listen to my fathers will and tried to go my own way, I was met with terrifying screaming or physical punishment that would set me back in line. It was no coincidence of this mixing of behavior between family and work life. When my Dad stopped working at that company and experienced a period of staying at home, a lot of that behavior tapered off.</p>
 <p>Both boss and employee swallow it all and become more unrecognizable to themselves and their social circle. In countless cases, the pain transforms into the pathology we call PTSD.</p>
 <p>

<h1>Trust</h1>
 <p>Trust people and don’t be seduced by the system. That’s the cure. That’s what we are doing with <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span>.</p>
 <p>As much as anything else, it is an alternative to finding ways to erode the imbalances that cause us to act on each other in ways that truly hurt our resilience and personality.</p>
