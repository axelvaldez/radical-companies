 <p>Being worthy of attention supports our survival.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Being worthy of attention is tied to survival.</p>
 <p>We want to be heard. Things are not real until the have an impact on the world. Mass shootings make that impact. Helping others make that impact. It is a choice.</p>
 <p>Force help us to be heard. Even the threat of force has that effect. <span class="_quotespan">Listen to what I have to say or I&rsquo;ll hurt you!</span>.</p>
 <p>There is no good or bad. It is only survival. <span class="_quotespan">Listen&hellip;</span>.</p>
 <p>The community may not see that way. But, I think, they are not going to survive&hellip; I will force them, I am justified!</p>
 <p>The same applies to families, the selected few. They help their survival by supporting the strong man&rsquo;s survival.</p>

<h1>Fluid</h1>
 <p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, things are fluid. More fluid than they were in the iron age or in the last century. Change is to be welcome. We will still operate out of foxholes, but we won&rsquo;t be afraid to get out of one and into the next one.</p>
 <p>In particular, communities are not anchored to location or familial relationships. We can make communities with anybody in the worl based on affinity and their ability to help me, and my ideas, survive. It is also important that I can help them. If I can&rsquo;t, if we lost that so important affinity, then we find a new community. The <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system cannot support that kind of fluidity, it goes against its interest. An alternative like the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> system does.</p>
