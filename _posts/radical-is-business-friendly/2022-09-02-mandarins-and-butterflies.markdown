 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> way colonizes your mind in the most insidous ways. Sometimes, it simply doesn&rsquo;t let you enjoy a mandarin. But you can make your own way, and you can fly.</p>

 <p>I have just been gifted this beautful story. It details how little by little you end up making your own life smaller and restricted. How you internalize the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> mindset and end up with a life interrupted, never letting yourself grow and mature.</p>
 <p>But you can find the strength, inside yourself, to fly.</p>

<div class="_quotation" style="width:90%; ">
 <p>I just came to a realization and I am writing to flush it out in my own head.</p>
 <p>I&rsquo;ve realized that until a few days ago, I&rsquo;ve spent my whole life hurting myself emotionally. To give you an example, I&rsquo;ve always been the type of person that if I tried a new food and I didn&rsquo;t like it, I would still finish it. I would think, <span class="_quotespan">you spent money on this, you have to make that money worth something.</span>. Finishing it would make it feel bad, but I felt I didn&rsquo;t have an option but to finish it even though I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying it. Recently, a friend told me that if I didn&rsquo;t like it, I didn&rsquo;t <em>have to</em> finish it. And I should not feel bad about it either: I tried something new to find out if I enjoyed it or not and if I don&rsquo;t like it, then I won&rsquo;t order it next time.</p>
 <p>Her words made me realize that I had normalized worrying about money most of all and putting money at the top of all my priorities. For big decision, that wasn&rsquo;t always the case, but for smaller, day-to-day decisions money was the overriding consideration.</p>
 <p>I have been here for a year and I have bought mandarins only once. Once! And only because they when went on sale, otherwise I would not have bought them. But back home I bought mandarins almost every day because it is my favorite fruit. Here the litte voice in my head told me that I could not have the pleasure because mandarins are too expensive and I couldn&rsquo;t afford them.</p>
 <p>These <em>little</em> decisions have been hurting me. They have made me feel bad and lead to the conclusiong that I don&rsquo;t deserve the things I like. Money has taken over and I have not been able to live my life according to what I really want for myself. I am having a toxic relationships with myslef, making myself feel bad for a while and then trying to make up for it, to compensate excessively: that has been the cycle of my life. When I accomplish something it feels that I am not worth it of it. The accomplishment itself seems unreal; maybe that was not an accomplishment after all. Or maybe it is not minde and I should not feel good or happy because something bad can come to take it away.</p>
 <p>I am starting to realize that I am bringing myself down with a mindset of reward and punishment. I have also realized that I haven&rsquo;t had a quality life and I&rsquo;ve been afraid to even think about it because of <em>money.</em> But coming to this realization has made me stronger. I am more sure of myself and the little voice in my head can&rsquo;t derail me because I now understand that money is a means, not an end.</p>
 <p>I went to the supermarket two days ago and guess what: I bought mandarins, even though they weren&rsquo;t on sale!</p>
 <p>I am making small changes, one step at a time and I feel I am on my way to live my own life. It is a bit ironic that it was this easy to do, that it was so difficult to realize how toxic conventional <span style="font-style:normal; ">[<span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>]</span> organizations are. Most of all, I was surprised that I could not see how it was affecting me.</p>
 <p>Now my <em>larva</em> is on its way to become a butterfuly :)</p>
