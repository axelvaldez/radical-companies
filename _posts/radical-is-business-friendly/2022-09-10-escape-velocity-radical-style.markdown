<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>We are pretty sure that we are not the first to come up with the model the book described in the book <em>RADICAL COMPANIES</em>. You find instances of communities and businesses everywhere in the world and at different times in history. However, an alternative model to the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system has never reached escape velocity.</p>

<h1>Precursors</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">Radical</span>-like groups have been around for a while: one comes up, others copy him, and they pick up some momentum, <em>but never enough</em>. The reasons range from the visionary leader passing away, dogma setting in, or the group being taken over by barbarians.</p>
 <p>What drives these barbarians to <em>take over</em>? Why do they believe they are winning when their chieftains get the long-term benefits of their work? Don&rsquo;t they, the people who do the <em>winning,</em> realize that they, too, can easily end up on the wrong side of this win-lose mindset?</p>
 <p>Or maybe <strong><em>we</em></strong> are all barbarians and we can&rsquo;t help it. It's just the human condition, so don&rsquo;t go against it. But, if in spite of it all, this, <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span>-like groups keep coming up, over and over again. Why?</p>
 <p>Maybe, just maybe, it is because the <em>barbarian</em> thing is a system? It encourages and guides people to act like barbarians.</p>
 <p>Then, how  that leads some people to act like barbarians did this system get started? And, why has it been so robust, so long-lasting?</p>

<h1>Money Did It</h1>
 <p>In <em>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</em><a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> author David Graeber proposes that the developmentt of coinage sparked the system we live in today. Author Paul Mason agrees,</p>
 <div class="_quotation">
  <p>Graeber says what emerged after 800 BCE was a ‘military-coinage-slave complex&rsquo;, which forms the common basis for very different&hellip; city states across China, India, and ancient Greece.<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 </div>
 <p>All of them, <em>China, India, and ancient Greece,</em> are remarkably long-lasting States.</p>

<h1>From Social Debt to Taxes</h1>
 <p>Before the arrival of coinage, debt was a social thing, based on reciprocity. Then coins arrived, quantified debt, which gave rise to taxes, and, finally, the State was born.</p>
 <p>This happened, first by force and then by habit. A few barbarians in a group declared that they were <em>owed</em> everybody&rsquo;s surplus value, or else. Over time, <em>barbarians</em> transformed into <em>defenders</em> and people <em>just paid</em> their debt to them as taxes.</p>
 <p>Tax, then, is a form of debt that can be paid with State coinage.</p>

<h1>Ideology</h1>
 <p>Ideology makes this tax-paying habit, paying this imaginary debt, easier to live with. <span class="_quotespan">The defenders keep me alive,</em> ideology says, <span class="_quotespan">they are good and necessary.</em> Eventually, this gets codified as, <span class="_quotespan">our King keeps us alive.</em></p>
 <p>This is obviously a very rough sketch of how the system could have gotten <em>started</em>.</p>
 <p>What <em>has kept it going</em> is that this system has been supported by the very people exploited by it: the footsoldiers, the mothers who bear them, the families and communities that feed and nourish them. Ideology made this system possible.</p>

<h1>Barbarians vs&hellip; ?</h1>
 <p>The ideology of the barbarians-as-defenders is simple: they get to live in abundance for minimal work. But, all this time there hasn&rsquo;t been a different ideology to unite the <em>defended.</em> Armed revolutions, unions, and the like are just variations of the <em>or-else</em>  ideology. <span class="_quotespan">Pry their privileges from their cold, dead fingers.</span> This approach simply makes the barbarian system stronger.</p>
 <p>What has been missing from the various approaches is a simple and clear foundation, a simple and memorable language, and easy to use tools. This is why, I am guessing, a lot of <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span>-like groups have not lasted very long.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> system is a more robust potential solution because it has those elements in place.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> vs <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span></h1>
 <p>Instead of <em>barbarian,</em> we call the force-based system <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> and the alternative <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span>,</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> Foundation</h1>
 <p>The Foundation is simple and easy to remember,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_h2table">
   <tr>
    <th>people</th>
    <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>commitments</th>
    <td>Decentralization & Transparency</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>practices</th>
    <td>Experimentation</td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </div>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> Language</h1>
  <p>In the model we use only two terms: co-ownership and co-management. These terms they take up new meanings in the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model.</p>
   <div class="_center">
    <table class="_h2table">
     <tr>
      <th>
       <p style="text-align:right; ">co-ownership</p>
      </th>
      <td>
       <p>People who embody a company are co-owners of it and can earn a <em>dynamic</em> piece of the value through recognized contributions to what they have created together.</p>
       <p>Note that co-ownership, as we define it, doesn&rsquo;t depend on a <em>static</em> number of <em>shares</em>, whose financial value comes from trading them but from people&rsquo; contributions.</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <th>
       <p style="text-align:right; width:9em; ">co-management</p>
      </th>
      <td>
       <p>Self-management makes sense as it applies to individuals. But in the case of a company, there is no <em>self</em> which can manage itself. People who embody the company, <em>manage it collaboratively</em>.</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
    </table>
   </div>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> Tools</h1>
 <h2><em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> App</h2>
  <p>We have a mobile app called <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> that supports <span class="_paradigm">RAD DISTRIBUTION</span>s.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Co-owners use the RADs! app to <em>recognize contributions</em>.</li>
   <li>Anybody can start a company or any other type of community by simply inviting  people to the <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> app.</li>
   <li>From recognized contributions, it calculates the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s given and received by each co-owner.</li>
   <li>The amount of RADs each person has earned determines their share of ownership (<em>i.e.</em>, the value created by all co-owners).</li>
   <li>The whole thing is transparent. Everybody can see who is given RADs to whom, how many RADs each co-owner has, etc. Among other benefits, this lets anybody raise a red flag when they see a problem.</li>
  </ul>
 <h2>Explicit Relationships</h2>
  <p><em>Explicit Relationships</em> help people come together and build trust from the start.</p>
  <p>Inspired by J Kim Wright&rsquo;s <em>Conscious Contracts<sup>®</sup></em> framework,<a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> an <em>Explicit Relationships</em> consists of four items that would-be co-owners discuss. Then, when they agree to come together as a community (see <a id="_aboutCommunity" href="#_appendix">Appendix</a>), they create an <em>Explicit Relationships</em> from their discussion notes.</p>
  <p>There are still lots of things to work out (<em>e.g.</em>, how to scale it), but so far we&rsquo;ve gotten good feedback, including this: <span class="_quotespan">some organizations never build up trust among people, even after years of operation.</span></p>

<h1>Reaching Escape Velocity</h1>
 <p>Simple Foundation, Language, and Tools, I believe, is what we need for the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model to build momentum and reach escape velocity.</p>
 <p>Many experiments will shape what this <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> thing will turn into. The people making it happen will develop the skills to collaborate with others, create value for their communities, and will enjoy direct, tangible benefits from this. Just as key, people will recognize each other, and collaborate on their journey towards a healthy future.</p>

<h1 class="_section">APPENDIX</h1>

<h1 id="_appendix">About Communities</h1>
 <p>A community could be,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>A legal entity (<em>e.g.</em>, C Corp, LLC, or an Unincorporated Association in California).</li>
  <li>A group of people working together, with no legal structure (<em>e.g.</em>, a RADs! app community).</li>
  <li>Temporary or permanent.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>One more thing: a community&rsquo;s boundary is porous, made up and changed by the people who embody the community as they come in and out of it easily.
