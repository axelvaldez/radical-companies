 <p>This book is for people who don&rsquo;t quite see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. They want to, but they don&rsquo;t yet see it.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>This book is for people who don&rsquo;t quite see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. They may not even know what the heck <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> means. But they are interested, they feel that the currect system is not working for them.</p>
 <p>You have to be open and ready to put aside everything you take for granted. You have to be open and ready to put aside everything has always been here and will always be part of us. You have to be open and ready to put aside much of you consider our &ldquo;nature.&rdquo; You have to be open and ready to question what is true about us.</p>
 <p>The alternative to <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is fundamentally different and will feel foreign and even crazy.</p>

 <p>If you are not open and ready for this, this is not the book for you. <span class='_quotespan'>Sounds interesting&hellip; tell me more about about it,</span> says you as you cross your arms and lean back on your comfortable chair. If that is you, return this book. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

<h1>Fiat?</h1>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>But <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is a car</span>. And it is, an Italian automobile brand that stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino.</em></p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is also an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> It also carries an implied <span class='_quotespan'>&hellip; or else</span> with it. <span class='_quotespan'>Move those boxes over there (because I say so&hellip; or else).</span></p>

<h1>The Fiat System</h1>
 <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <em>system</em>. Some people <em>do not</em> like the word <em>system</em> associated with their lives, and that is understandable. <span class='_quotespan'>My life is not encased in a system, I shape it however I want to.</span> However, that is what it is: you and I live within a system.</p>
 <p>We created the system and we maintain it. Money is a medium of exchange, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. The military (nominally) protect our borders, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. We get our food at grocery stores, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. These are elements of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system that we created, we live in, and we uphold and maintain.</p>
 <p>Luckily, there are alternatives to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>

<h1>It Starts with Rules</h1>
 <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Drug addicts were at the edge, too.</p>
 <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to a pre-school. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotespan'>did you hit him back harder</span>) and learn new ones (<span class='_quotespan'>keep your hands to yourself</span>).</p>
 <p>Lucky that we are, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. <span class='_quotespan'>That will be on the test!</span> In primary school, too, is when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <img

    width='70%'
    alt=''>
  </div>
 <p>If we happen to be live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simple fiddling with them and learning to make them more comfortable. No matter, we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off. We want to stay far away from the edge.</p>
 <p>Finally, we go to work, with our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and how to be a good worker.  We are hppy to be a resource and happier that we are getting a steady wage (until we are not). We learn to be kind and condescending to the ones whose glasses are skewed and not fitting correctly. <span class='_quotespan'>We do our best for these people, but they just don&rsquo;t want to learn the rules.</span></p>
 
<h1>The Fiat System Is&hellip;</h1>
 <p>That is what <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <strong>system</strong> is,
  <ul>
   <li>Learning the rules,</li>
   <li>Following the rules,</li>
   <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Think of what happens <em>when you get caught</em> not following the rules.<a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Think of how many decision you have made, now think if you did it without considering in the back of your head what your boss would think of it. <span class='_quotespan'>Bob would want it this way</span>. Think of how many times you have said, <span class='_quotespan'>I am pretty sure that Bob is not going tot like it!</span> You can&rsquo;t make a decision without considering Bob. <span class='_quotespan'>How else would the system work? Things would not work without Bob.</span> That&rsquo;s what constantly happens in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. You do what you do <em>because of Bob, the boss</em>.</p>
 </p>

<h1>The Book</h1>
 <p>The rest of the book takes it one theme are a time. It then compares how it works in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and how it would work in a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. Because I am describing a system, you may find the book repetitive.</p>
 <p>Even if you already see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> and its consequences, it might be worth skimming through the book not to be surprised when you tried to explain it to somebody else and the questions come (and keep coming).</p>

<h1>Rules, Laws, and Force</h1>
 <p>Rules, followed by convention, eventually turn into <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> laws which <em>you are <em>forced</em> to follow,</em></p>
  <ul>
   <li>If you don&rsquo;t, you  get a ticket. A very minor form of force. You have to give up money (<em>i.e.</em>, coined force) to be spared the pain that would follow if you don&rsquo;t.</li>
   <li>If you feel that is an injustice, you let it go to court (<em>i.e.</em>, another type of force).</li>
   <li>If they rule in your behalf, you celebrate; if they don&rsquo;t, you are angry and you have to pay the ticket. Still minor force.</li>
   <li>On the other hand, if you happen to be from the edge, it may get ugly and you may end up in prison. No longer a minor force.</li>
   <li>In prison you end in a fight and you are maimed or killed or vice versa. Either way, it is definitely a <em>force majeure</em>.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Force is ever present in out <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. It goes from a frown to the electric chair. Withholding a prize because you did not said or did what was expected of you is a form of force. Getting passed over for a raise or promotion is a form of force. Firing you or the more euphemistic &ldquo;laying you off&rdquo; is a form of force. Raising you rent so your only option is to leave is a form of force. We are surrounded by a system that runs on force.</p>
 <p>Motivation is another form of force. <span class='_quotespan'>Do this and you'll get the reward.</span> Realize that that is coming from somebody else. You are &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; to do what somebody else wants. You may want to do something else but you have to do what is specified by someone else to get the reward. That is force.</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>In an alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system there is no you-have-do-it-or-else force. The myth is that without <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> force we would never do anything of significance, we would never do anything bigger than ourselves. And is a myth because we managed to survive as a species. We invented agriculture. Agriculture spread to all corners of the earth. We managed to do all that and more without anybody telling how to do it.<p>
 <p>Then came the people who took things by force, because they had nothing to trade but force. And then came money, coinage which allowed them to trade the wealth that the rest of us created. And slowly by surely the Fiat system took shape with us in it. And we believe the stories that came up to support it; a top supernatural being, paradise, Eve and the bad apple, and eating shellfish as an abomination. And we believe these Iron age stories to these days. Including the stories about work and how that elevates above the crowd, definitely above the people from the edge.</p>
 <p>Most insidous of all, we learn to expect that the fruit of our work would go to someone else, the smaller god, the omnipotent being at the top, the boss. And that we get paid what the boss says we should get paid.</p>
 <p>It didn&rsquo;t start this way, but it evolved. First came prisoners of minor wars, that were made to carry whatever the winners didn&rsquo;t want to carry. At the end they either joined the winners (after all, they were related) or they went back to their village. Then came slavery, they kep you as a worthless worker because they have the force. Finally came work in exchange for wage. This is the general direction of the evolution, from forced labor by sheer force to forced labor by coin. Different form of force, but force throughout.</p>
 <p>This got absorbed by the Fiat system to the point that &ldquo;being a good worker&rdquo; is a sign of pride today. There is nothing strange about it, it is normal. The alternative is chaos, to be avoided at all costs. Anybody talking alternatives (you and I) must be crazy.</p>
 <p>--</p>
 <p>The alternative is not chaos, but it is different.</p>
 <p>For one, there&rsquo;s no force. There&rsquo;s persuasion, there is convicing, there is guilt. But there is no force to make you do something that you don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
 <p>--</p>
 <p>Religion is part of the support system as well, but before we talk about that, we have to talk about divide-and-conquer.</p>

<h1>Countries and Other Divisions</h1>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>Countries are <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> creations, straight out of chiefdoms and later kingdons. Empires were mostly nations or were cleansed by force.</p>
  <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to the Americas, they cleansed most of their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act as Catholics and speak Castillian (or else). In fact, the Inquisition made sure that the converted were truly convicing Catholics and spoke the language of the Church.</p>
  <p>By the time they got to the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla had developed a methodology to cleanse whatever other cultures they encountered.</p>
 <h2>Divide and Conquer</h2>
  <p>At some point women were made second to men and were made subservient to them. Men were the kings of their castle and women were chattel.  It all went inside, bundled with a strong ideology and women became pillars of the institution. <span class='_quotespan'>Eve was the bad apple,</span> and she had better submit for salvation.</p>
  <p>And women covered their hair and wore burkas as a matter of duty.</p>
  <p>As Christianity spread, non-Europeans got pushed to be subservient to Europeans all over the world. Of course, there were wealthy non-Europeans and poor non-Europeans. The wealthier was treated better and oftentimes put in charge.</p>
  <p>We are still struggling with that attitude today, thousands of years later.</p>
 <h2>Lording</h2>
  <p>With men lording over half of the population, it was easier for a few to lord over men. They could appeal to the stories and the making up of history. They certainly supported the making of kingdoms and empires. <span class='_quotespan'>We could be in paradise, but the woman enticed us to bite the apple of knowledge and poisoned us.</span></p>
  <p>The Jewish tradition, Christianity, and Islam have an eternal boss named God, at the top. You would dare to even think of equitable, you can only submit to God. In Christianity, the Pope is the only one that could understand what God wished. They won, I claim, because they had the better story, compared to Judaism and Islam.</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <h2>Non-Fiat</h2>
  <p>In an alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, there is no imposed hierarchy. If you believe in supernatural beings, so be it, but the story of the omnipotent boss at the top doesn&rsquo;t work anymore; in fact, that believe works against our survival as a species.</p>
  <p>The alternative is not chaos, but it is different,</p>
 <h2>Community</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>In my decentralized and fully transparent community I trust.</li>
   <li>What is going to keep my community growing is what&rsquo;s good for them which is what is good for me.</li>
   <li>People in my community listens to me and help make my ideas easier to understand.</li>
   <li>If that is not the case, I leave (and keep what ownership I&rsquo;ve earned to that point).</li>
  </ul>
 <h2>Foundation</h2>
  <p>This is the <span class='_paradigm'>Foundation</span> of a community,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A community must provide me with Meaning. This is a community that I want to Belong to.</li>
    <li>To work for <em>every</em> member, the community must be fully decentralized and transparent.</li>
    <li>Members are free to experiment. The only rules are those the community agrees to, and even those could be negotiated.</li>
   </ul>
 <h2>Alignment</h2>
  <p>But the <span class='_paradigm'>Foundation</span> is not enough, it needs an <span class='_paradigm'>Explicit Alignment</span>,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>To hold us together a community must define the <em>what for</em>, the <span class='_paradigm'>Impact</span>, that it wants to have on the world.</li>
    <li>It must be explicit about the <em>why</em>, its <span class='_paradigm'>Purpose</span>, that made it come together as a community.</li>
    <li>The community can then define the <em>what, when, and how,</em> the <span class='_paradigm'>Mission</span>, of the work it needs to do.</li>
   </ul>
   <div class='_center'>
    <img
     src='/assets/img/pic-explicit-alignment-en.svg'
     width='70%'
     alt=''>
    </div>
   <p>It is <em>explicit</em> in that it lays it all out for every member of the community to know; there are no dark corners where need-to-know data is kept away from view.</p>
   <p>It is &ldquo;alignment&rdquo; in the sense that it that it ties people together into a community with something in common.</p>
   <p>To be clear,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>If the <em>what for</em>, the <span class='_paradigm'>Impact</span>, is not your thing, then you don't join the community. In theory it could be changed, but in practice it would make it a different community. It would be like transforming a hardware company into a software company. Sun Microsystems failed at it because it is very, very difficult.</li>
    <li>If the <em>why</em>, the <span class='_paradigm'>Purpose</span>, doesn&rsquo;t work for you it is somewhat easier to change. Not a walk in the park, but easier to change. And if that doesn&rsquo;t work, you don&rsquo;t join the community.</li>
    <li>The <em>what, when, and how</em>, the <span class='_paradigm'>Mission</span>, changes all the time. People may be pursuing different Missions in parallel and you may join one of them. Or you may create you own with the support of the community.</li>
   </ul>
 <h2>No Divisions</h2>
  <p>All members are co-onwers of the community. If their goal is to build products or services it would be called a company.</p>
  <p>I make a distinction between a business and a company,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Businesses is what we are used to. Their one and only goal is to make wealth for the owner. It may start with different ideals, but in the end it has got to make wealth for the owner. You work at a business for a wage agreed upon by the owner.</li>
    <li>A company is a group of people that comes together as a community to improve the wellbeing of their members. We call these members co-onwers. They own everything about the company, including its revenue. The level of co-ownership is not equal, as in co-ops, but equitable to their contributions. BTW, the word company comes from Laten <em>co</em>, meaning <em>together</em>, and <em>pan</em>, meaning <em>bread</em>.</li>
    <li>The level of co-ownership is determined by contributions, not capital.</li>
    <li>These contributions are recognized by all other co-owners.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>And, yes, there is an app for that.</p> 

<h1>Capital and Contributions</h1>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>The default is that the only way to contribute to, a new business, is to give it capital. Said capital investment gives the investors power over the company. But, power is force. In the US investors don&rsquo;t have any power over company operations, but they can replace the CEO. And they can keep replacig him until they find one that runs the opporations according to their wishes. Those are some of the side-effect of seeing capital as the only way to contribute.</p>
  <p>You have no owership in the business. You get your salary and that is that. Some people, like Sales, gets paid commissions for a limited time.</p>

 <h2>Non-Fiat</h2>
  <p>This is probably the most shocking thing about non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> alternatives: companies are not there to make founders and investors wealthy. Companies have to make money and be self-sustainable. But what usually goes into the pocket of the owners, now goes into the pockets of the co-ownersk, into the pockets of everybody who contributes to creating the wealth. If you were looking for yet another way to become wealthy, this ain&rsquo;t it. Companies are way to increase the wellbeing of every co-owner and the society around then.</p>
  <p>Non-capital can be contributions, too, usually the most valualble contribution. As I said earlier, a company is a group of co-owners that come together to improve the wellbeing of their members and the society around them. They are the only ones that can recognize a contribution because because they are workig shoulder to shoulder with you and know what&rsquo;s valuable to their common effort.</p>
  <p>Your level of co-ownership is determined by these contributions given to you by your co-owner peers. You recognized contributions determines your level of co-ownership <em>that month.</em> Next most it will most likely be differet.</p>
 <h2>The Calculations</h2>
  <p>The number of contributions that each co-owner recognizes within a month for other co-owners becomes the denominator. The number of RADs is the numerator. In other words, you get a <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span> every day to give, not to keep. In a 30-day month, you get 30 <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s and those 30 <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are shared among the co-owner for whom you have reconized one or more contribution.</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <img
     src='/assets/img/pic-recognitions-to-rads-equation.svg'
     width='70%'
     alt=''>
   </div>
  <p>There is an mobile app that does the calculation.</p>
  <p>As you give those <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s away, you are given other people ownership in the company. No boss is necessary to give attaboys to his favorites.</p>
 <h2>But&hellip;</h2>
  <p>At this point you may be coming up with objections. <span class='_quotespan'>Yeah, but it can be easily gamed: I&rsquo;ll give you all my <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s and you give me all of yours. And yes, it could, but only if the other co-owners do not say or do anything about. Because of &ldquo;Transparecy,&rdquo; they can see all the transactions and it is up to the co-owners to say or do something. They can have a conversation with people who are trying to game the process. If they do not change their behavior, co-owners can decide to not recognize any of the contributions because they are doing something that works agaist a very fundamental action that would make co-ownership a joke.</span></p>
  <p>Another objection might be that people won&rsquo;t want to take the time to recognize contributions. They may do it at first, but then they slowly stop. Again, the data is there for all to see and if all co-owners stop recognizing contributions, then they won&rsquo;t get any more co-ownership, including the take of the revenue. They may slow down until they see the result and then they will go back to doing it. If not, the company will fail, as well it should. On the way to a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> alternative things won&rsquo;t go perfect or smoothly. There will be plenty of bumps along the way. The &rdquo;fix&ldquo; is not to elect a boss to tell us what to do, the fix is to fix your behaviour&mdash;you are all co-owners.</p>
  <p>My favorite is when people say that <em>other</em> people are coin operated. They do not want to do anything for a community of society. My usual retort is, <span class='_quotespan'>what about family?</span> They do a lot backing out then, but some people double down, <span class='_quotespan'>my will eventually have to fend for themselves.</span> You can imagine where it goes from there (but I won&rsquo;t repeat it here). The thing is that homo economicus is one of those conveniebt stories that poped up to suppport the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> sytstem. People have to survive and they will go to kinds of length to do it, but survival is not living.</p>
 <h2>Capital</h2>
  <p>Capital does have a place in a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> company, but not as a regular <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> investment: you give me money, I give a fixed percent of the business. A non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat Investment</span> is nore like a loan in that you get your principal back. It is an investment in that the return-on-investment is negotiated, but how much and how it&rsquo;s paid.</p>
  <p>Usually that capital goes to pay for things needed for the company and to fund a Predictable Recurrig Income (PRI) fund. The PRI is used to pay co-owners a predictable, recurring amount of money when there is little or no revenue. The PRI is normally paid back by the revenue each co-owner gets given their <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s. Until it is paid in full by revenue, what a co-owner takes of out of the PRI fund is a personal debt.</p>
