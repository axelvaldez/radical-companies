 <p>This book is for people who don&rsquo;t quite see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. They want to, but they don&rsquo;t yet see it.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>This book is for people who don&rsquo;t quite see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. They may not even know what the heck <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> means. But they are interested, they feel that the currect system is not working for them.</p>
 <p>You have to be open and ready to put aside everything you take for granted. You have to be open and ready to put aside everything has always been here and will always be part of us. You have to be open and ready to put aside much of you consider our &ldquo;nature.&rdquo; You have to be open and ready to question what is true about us.</p>
 <p>The alternative to <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is fundamentally different and will feel foreign and even crazy.</p>

 <p>If you are not open and ready for this, this is not the book for you. <span class='_quotespan'>Sounds interesting&hellip; tell me more about about it,</span> says you as you cross your arms and lean back on your comfortable chair. If that is you, return this book. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

<h1>Fiat?</h1>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>But <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is a car</span>. And it is, an Italian automobile brand that stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino.</em></p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is also an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> It also carries an implied <span class='_quotespan'>&hellip; or else</span> with it. <span class='_quotespan'>Move those boxes over there (because I say so&hellip; or else).</span></p>

<h1>The Fiat System</h1>
 <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <em>system</em>. Some people <em>do not</em> like the word <em>system</em> associated with their lives, and that is understandable. <span class='_quotespan'>My life is not encased in a system, I shape it however I want to.</span> However, that is what it is: you and I live within a system.</p>
 <p>We created the system and we maintain it. Money is a medium of exchange, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. The military (nominally) protect our borders, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. We get our food at grocery stores, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. These are elements of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system that we created, we live in, and we uphold and maintain.</p>
 <p>Luckily, there are alternatives to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>

<h1>It Starts with Rules</h1>
 <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Drug addicts were at the edge, too.</p>
 <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to Kindergarten. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotespan'>did you hit him back harder</span>) and learn new ones (<span class='_quotespan'>keep your hands to yourself</span>).</p>
 <p>Lucky that we are, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. <span class='_quotespan'>That will be on the test!</span> In primary school, too, is when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>

 <p>If we happen to be live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simple fiddling with them and learning to make them more comfortable. No matter, we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off. BecauseWe want to stay off the edge.</p>
 <p>Finally, we go to work, with our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and how to be a good worker.  We are hppy to be a resource and happier that we are getting a steady wage (until we are not). We learn to be kind and condescending to the ones whose glasses are skewed and not fitting correctly. We do our best for these people, but they just don&rsquo;t want to learn the rules.</p>
 
<h1>The Fiat System Is&hellip;</h1>
 <p>That is what <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <strong>system</strong> is,
  <ul>
   <li>Learning the rules,</li>
   <li>Following the rules,</li>
   <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Think of what happens <em>when you get caught</em> not following the rules.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Think of how many decision you have made, now think if you did it without considering in the back of your head what your boss would think of it. <span class='_quotespan'>Bob would want it this way</span>. Think of how many times you have said, <span class='_quotespan'>I am pretty sure that Bob is not going tot like it!</span> You can&rsquo;t make a decision without considering Bob. <span class='_quotespan'>How else would the system work? Things would not work without Bob.</span> That&rsquo;s what constantly happens in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. You do what you do <em>because of Bob</em>.</p>
 </p>

<h1>The Book</h1>
 <p>The rest of the book takes it one <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> theme are a time. It then compares how it works in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and how it would work in a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. Because I am describing a system, you may find the book repetitive.</p>
 <p>Even if you already see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> and its consequences, it might be worth skimming through the book not to be surprised when you tried to explain it to somebody else and the questions come (and keep coming).</p>

<h1>Rules, Laws, and Force</h1>
 <p>Rules, followed by convention, eventually turn into <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> laws which <em>you are <em>forced</em> to follow,</em></p>
  <ul>
   <li>If you don&rsquo;t, you  get a ticket. A very minor form of force. You have to give up money (<em>i.e.</em>, coined force) to be spared the pain that would follow if you don&rsquo;t.</li>
   <li>If you feel that is an injustice, you let it go to court (<em>i.e.</em>, another type of force).</li>
   <li>If they rule in your behalf, you celebrate; if they don&rsquo;t, you are angry and you have to pay the ticket. Still minor force.</li>
   <li>On the other hand, if you happen to be from the edge, it may get ugly and you may end up in prison. No longer a minor force.</li>
   <li>In prison you end in a fight and you are maimed or killed or vice versa. Either way, it is definitely a <em>force majeure</em>.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Force is ever present in out <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. It goes from a frown to the electric chair. Withholding a prize because you did not said or did what was expected of you is a form of force.</p>
 <p>Motivation is another form of force. <span class='_quotespan'>Do this and you'll get the reward.</span> Realize that that is coming from somebody else. You are &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; to do what somebody else wants. You may want to do something else but you have to do what is specified by someone else to get the reward. That is force.</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>In an alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system there is no you-have-do-it-or-else force. The myth is that without <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> force we would never do anything of significance, we would never do anything bigger than ourselves. And so goes the myth.<p>
 <p>First came prisoners of minor wars. They were made to carry whatever the winners didn&rsquo;t want to carry. At the end they either joined the winners (they were related) or they went back to their village. Then came slavery, we caught you and you are ours because we have the force. Finally, came work where if you want money, you have to do what I say to do. Not very scientific, but generally the direction it followed from forced labor by sheer force to force labor by coin. Force throughout.</p>
 <p>And we made a system out of it to the point that &ldquo;being a good worker&rdquo; is a sign of pride today. There is nothing strange about it. It is normal. The alternative is chaos, to be avoided at all costs. Anybody talking alternatives (us) must be crazy.</p>
 <p>Religion is part of the support system as well, but before we talk about that, we have to talk about divide-and-conquer.</p>

<h1>Countries and Other Divisions</h1>
 <p>Countries are <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> creations, straight out of chiefdoms and later kingdons. Countries were mostly nations and when they weren&rsquo;t they were made so by force.</p>
 <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to the Americas, they cleansed most of their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act as Catholics and speak Castillian (or else). So, by the time they got to the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla had developed a methodology to cleanse whatever other cultures they encountered.</p>
 <p>At some point women were made second to men and were made subservient to them. Men were the kings of their castle and women became a pillar of that institution. It all went inside bundled by a strong ideology. It worked marvelously for men. As Christianity spread, women and non-Europeans got pushed to be subservient to European men all over the world.</p>
 <p>Eve was the bad apple and she had better work for salvation. Women covered their hair and wore burkas as a matter of duty. We are still struggling with that attitude today, thousands of years later.</p>
 <p>With men lording over the fully supportive half of the population, strongmen could lord over men. They could appeal to the ideologies/religions stories and the making up of convenient history. They certainly supported the making of kingdoms and empires. <span class='_quotespan'>We could be in paradise, but the woman gave the man the apple of knowledge and poisoned him.</span> The Jewish tradition, Christianity, and Islam have an eternal boss named God, at the top. You would dare to even think of equitable, you can only submit to God. In Christianity, the Pope is the only one that could understand what God wished. They won, I claim, because they had the better story, compared to Judaism and Islam.</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>In an alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, there is no imposed hierarchy. If you believe in a god, so be it, but the story of the omnipotent boss at the top doesn&rsquo;t work anymore for the rest of it; in fact, an omnipotent being at the to works against our survival as a species.</p>
 <p>In my decentralized and fully transparent community I trust. What is going to keep my community growing is what&rsquo;s good for them which is what is good for me.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>To become a community, it must provide me with Meaning; this is a community that I want to Belong to.</li>
  <li>To work for every member of the community, it must be fully decentralized and transparent.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>This is the community&rsquo;s Foundation. But that&rsquo;s not enough,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>To hold us together a community must define the <em>what for</em>, the Impact, that it wants to have on the world.</li>
  <li>It must be explicit about the <em>why</em>, its Purpose, that made it come together as a community.</li>
  <li>The community can then define the <em>what, when, and how,</em> the Mission, of the work it needs to do.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>This is its Explicit Alignment. It is explicit in that it lays it all out for every member of the community to know; there are no dark corner where need-to-know data is kept. Is it Alignment in the sense that it gives a community of people something in common.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>If the <em>what for</em>, the Impact, is not your thing, then you don't join the community. In theory it could be changed, but in practice it would make it a different community. It would be like transforming a hardware company into a software company. Sun Microsystems failed at it because it is very, very difficult.</li>
   <li>If the <em>why</em>, the Purpose, doesn&rsquo;t work for you it is somewhat easier to change. Not a walk in the park, but easier to change. And if that doesn&rsquo;t work, you don&rsquo;t join the community.</li>
   <li>The <em>what, when, and how</em>, the Mission, changes all the time. People may be pursuing different Missions in parallel and you may join one of them. Or you may create you own with the support of the community.</li>
  </ul>
