<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>This book is for people who don&rsquo;t quite see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>.  They want to, but they don&rsquo;t yet see it. <span class='_quotespan'>Sounds interesting&hellip; tell me more about about it,</span> says you as you cross your arms and lean back on your comfortable chair.</p>
 <p>If that is you, return this book. Sorry for the confusion.</p>

<h1>Fiat?</h1>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is an Italian automobile brand; it stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino.</em></p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is also an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> It also carries an implied <span class='_quotespan'>&hellip; or else.</span> with it. <span class='_quotespan'>Move those boxes over there (because I say so&hellip; or else).</span></p>

<h1>The Fiat System</h1>
 <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> sytem. Some people <em>do not</em> like the word <em>system</em> associated with their lives, and that is understandable. However, that is what it is: we all live within a system. Money is a systemic medium of exchange, the armines protect our border (nominally), and we get our food at a grocery store. These are elemenbts of the sytem we live in.</p>

<h1>How We Are Brought Up Is Also Systemic</h1>
 <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the "edge" included people with Down Syndrom, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Drug addicts were at the edge, too.</p>
 <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to Kindergarten. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotepan'>did you hit him back harder</span>) and learn new ones (<span>keep your hands to yourself</span>).</p>
 <p>And then, if we continue to be lucky, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also learn the sanctioned view of the world. There will be a test of that. That is, BTW, when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>

 <p>If we contine be very lucky <em>and</em> we happen to be live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simple learning to have fit better. And we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off.</p>
 <p>Finally, we go to work. With our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and what a good worker is. We learn to be kind and condescending to the non-conformist, the ones whose glasses are askewed and not fitting correctly. We do our best fo these people, be they don&rsquo;t want to learn.</p>
 <p>That is what <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is,
  <ul>
   <li>Learning the rules,</li>
   <li>Following the rules,</li>
   <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
  </ul>
 </p>

<h1>The Book</h1>
 <p>We are going to take it very slow, one theme are a time and compare how it works in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and how it would work ih non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>
