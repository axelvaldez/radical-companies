<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>This book is for people who don&rsquo;t quite see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>.  They want to, but they don&rsquo;t yet see it. <span class='_quotespan'>Sounds interesting&hellip; tell me more about about it,</span> says you as you cross your arms and lean back on your comfortable chair.</p>
 <p>If that is you, return this book. Sorry for the confusion.</p>

<h1>Fiat?</h1>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is an Italian automobile brand; it stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino.</em></p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is also an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> It also carries an implied <span class='_quotespan'>&hellip; or else.</span> with it. <span class='_quotespan'>Move those boxes over there (because I say so&hellip; or else).</span></p>

<h1>The Fiat System</h1>
 <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> sytem. Some people <em>do not</em> like the word <em>system</em> associated with their lives, and that is understandable. However, that is what it is: we all live within a system. Money is a systemic medium of exchange, the military (nominally) protect our borders, and we get our food at grocery stores. These are elements of the sytem we live in.</p>

<h1>How We Are Brought Up Is Also Systemic</h1>
 <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the "edge" included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Drug addicts were at the edge, too.</p>
 <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to Kindergarten. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotespan'>did you hit him back harder</span>) and learn new ones (<span class='_quotespan'>keep your hands to yourself</span>).</p>
 <p>If we continue to be lucky, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. <span class='_quotespan'>There will be on the test.</span> That is, BTW, when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>

 <p>If we continue be very lucky <em>and</em> we happen to be live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simple learning to have them fit better. And we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off.</p>
 <p>Finally, we go to work, with our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and what a good worker is. We learn to be kind and condescending to the non-conformist, the ones whose glasses are askewed and not fitting correctly. We do our best for these people, but they just don&rsquo;t want to learn the rules.</p>
 <p>That is what <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <strong>system</strong> is,
  <ul>
   <li>Learning the rules,</li>
   <li>Following the rules,</li>
   <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>In your own life, think of what happens when you get caught not following the rules. Think of how many decision you have taken without considering in the back of your head what your boss would think of it. Think of how many times you have said or have considered saying, <span class='_quotespan'>I am pretty sure that Bob,</span> the boss, <span class='_quotespan'>is not going tot like it!</span> That&rsquo;s what constantly happens in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. You do what you do <em>because Bob says so</em>.</p>
 </p>

<h1>The Book</h1>
 <p>In the remainder of this book we are going to take it one theme are a time and compare how it works in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and how it would work ih non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. Even if you see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>, it might be worth skimming it to not get caught by susprise when the questions come.</p>
