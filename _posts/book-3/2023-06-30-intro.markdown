<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>This book is for people who don&rsquo;t quite see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>.  They want to, but they don&rsquo;t yet see it. <span class='_quotespan'>Sounds interesting&hellip; tell me more about about it,</span> says you as you cross your arms and lean back on your comfortable chair.</p>
 <p>If that is you, return this book. Sorry for the confusion.</p>

<h1>Fiat?</h1>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is an Italian automobile brand; it stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino.</em></p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is also an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> It also carries an implied <span class='_quotespan'>&hellip; or else.</span> with it. <span class='_quotespan'>Move those boxes over there (because I say so&hellip; or else).</span></p>

<h1>The Fiat System</h1>
 <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <em>system</em>. Some people <em>do not</em> like the word <em>system</em> associated with their lives, and that is understandable. <span class='_quotespan'>My life is not encased in a system, I shape it however I want to.</span> However, that is what it is: you and I live within a system.</p>
 <p>We created the system and we maintain it. Money is a medium of exchange within the system. The military (nominally) protect our borders within the system. We get our food at grocery stores withing the system. These are elements of the sytem we created, we live in, and we maintain.</p>
 <p>There are alternatives. I don't believe that &ldquo;this is the end&rdquo;, but I do see that this system is getting too complicated and it is becoming unmaintainable.</p>

<h1>It Starts with Rules</h1>
 <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Drug addicts were at the edge, too.</p>
 <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to Kindergarten. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotespan'>did you hit him back harder</span>) and learn new ones (<span class='_quotespan'>keep your hands to yourself</span>).</p>
 <p>Lucky that we are, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. <span class='_quotespan'>That will be on the test!</span> In primary school also is when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>

 <p>If we happen to be live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simple fiddling with them and learning to make them more comfortable. No matter, we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off.</p>
 <p>Finally, we go to work, with our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and how to be a good worker. We learn to be kind and condescending to the ones whose glasses are askewed and not fitting correctly. We do our best for these people, but they just don&rsquo;t want to learn the rules.</p>
 
<h1>The Fiat System Is&hellip;</h1>
 <p>That is what <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <strong>system</strong> is,
  <ul>
   <li>Learning the rules,</li>
   <li>Following the rules,</li>
   <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Think of what happens <em>when you get caught</em> not following the rules.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Think of how many decision you have made, now think if you did it without considering in the back of your head what your boss would think of it. <span class='_quotespan'>Bob would want it this way</span>. Think of how many times you have said, <span class='_quotespan'>I am pretty sure that Bob is not going tot like it!</span> You can&rsquo;t make a decision without considering Bob. <span class='_quotespan'>How else would the system work? Things would not work without Bob.</span> That&rsquo;s what constantly happens in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. You do what you do <em>because of Bob</em>.</p>
 </p>

<h1>The Book</h1>
 <p>The rest of the book takes it one <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> theme are a time. It then compares how it works in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and how it would work in a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. Because I am describing a system, you may find the book repetitive.</p>
 <p>Even if you already see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> and its consequences, it might be worth skimming through the book not to be surprised when you tried to explain it to somebody else and the questions come (and keep coming).</p>

<h1>Rules, Laws, and Force</h1>
 <p>Rules, followed by convention, eventually turn into <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> laws which <em>you are <em>forced</em> to follow,</em></p>
  <ul>
   <li>If you don&rsquo;t, you  get a ticket. A very minor form of force. You have to give up money (<em>i.e.</em>, coined force) to be spared the pain that would follow if you don&rsquo;t.</li>
   <li>If you feel that is an injustice, you let it go to court (<em>i.e.</em>, another type of force).</li>
   <li>If they rule in your behalf, you celebrate; if they don&rsquo;t, you are angry and you have to pay the ticket. Still minor force.</li>
   <li>On the other hand, if you happen to be from the edge, it may get ugly and you may end up in prison. No longer a minor force.</li>
   <li>In prison you end in a fight and you are maimed or killed or viceversa. Either way, it is definitely a <em>force majeure</em>.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Force is ever present in out <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. It goes from a frown to the electric chair. Witholding a prize because you did not said or did what was expected of you is a form of force.</p>
 <p>Motivation is another form of force. <span class='_quotespan'>Do this and you'll get the reward.</span> Realize that that is coming from somebody else. You are &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; to do what somebody else wants. You may want to do something else but you have to do what is specified by someone else to get the reward. That is force.</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>In an alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system there is no you-have-do-it-or-else force. The myth is that without <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> force we would never do anything of significance, we would never do anything bigger than ourselves. And so goes the myth.<p>
 <p>First came prisioners of minor wars. They were made to carry whatever the winners didn&rsquo;t want to carry. At the end they either joined the winners (they were related) or they went back to their village. Then came slavery, we caught you and you are ours because we have the force. Finally, came work where if you want money, you have to do what I say to do. Not very scientific, but generally the direction it followed from forced labor by sheer force to force labor by coin. Force throughout.</p>
 <p>And we made a system out of it to the point that &ldquo;being a good worker&rdquo; is a sign of pride today. There is nothing strange about it. It is normal. The alternative is chaos, to be avoided at all costs. Anybody talking alternatives (us) must be crazy.</p>
 <p>Religion is part of the support system as well, but before we talk about that, we have to talk about divide-and-conquer.</p>

<li>Countries and Other Divisions</li>
 <p>Countries are <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> creatinons. They come straight out of chiefdoms and later kingdowns. Empires didn't last so long, but countries did. Countries were mostly nations and when they weren&rsquo;t they were made so by force. Before Fernando and Isabel went to the Americas, they cleansed most of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, and ohers were forced to speak Castillian (or else). So, by the time they got to the Americas, they had developed a methodology that had proven to work.</p>
