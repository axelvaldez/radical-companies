<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>This book is for people who don&rsquo;t quite see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>.  They want to, but they don&rsquo;t yet see it. <span class='_quotespan'>Sounds interesting&hellip; tell me more about about it,</span> says you as you cross your arms and lean back on your comfortable chair.</p>
 <p>If that is you, return this book. Sorry for the confusion.</p>

<h1>Fiat?</h1>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is an Italian automobile brand; it stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino.</em></p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is also an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> It also carries an implied <span class='_quotespan'>&hellip; or else.</span> with it. <span class='_quotespan'>Move those boxes over there (because I say so&hellip; or else).</span></p>

<h1>The Fiat System</h1>
 <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <em>system</em>. Some people <em>do not</em> like the word <em>system</em> associated with their lives, and that is understandable. <span class='_quotespan'>My life is not encased in a system, I shape it however I want to.</span> However, that is what it is: you and I live within a system.</p>
 <p>We created the system and we maintain it. Money is a medium of exchange within the system. The military (nominally) protect our borders within the system. We get our food at grocery stores withing the system. These are elements of the sytem we created, we live in, and we maintain.</p>
 <p>There are alternatives. I don't believe that &ldquo;this is the end&rdquo;, but I do see that this system is getting too complicated and it is becoming unmaintainable.</p>

<h1>It Starts with Rules</h1>
 <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Drug addicts were at the edge, too.</p>
 <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to Kindergarten. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotespan'>did you hit him back harder</span>) and learn new ones (<span class='_quotespan'>keep your hands to yourself</span>).</p>
 <p>Lucky that we are, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. <span class='_quotespan'>That will be on the test!</span> In primary school also is when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>

 <p>If we happen to be live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simple fiddling with them and learning to make them more comfortable. No matter, we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off.</p>
 <p>Finally, we go to work, with our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and how to be a good worker. We learn to be kind and condescending to the ones whose glasses are askewed and not fitting correctly. We do our best for these people, but they just don&rsquo;t want to learn the rules.</p>
 
<h1>The Fiat System Is&hellip;</h1>
 <p>That is what <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <strong>system</strong> is,
  <ul>
   <li>Learning the rules,</li>
   <li>Following the rules,</li>
   <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Think of what happens <em>when you get caught</em> not following the rules.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Think of how many decision you have made, now think if you did it without considering in the back of your head what your boss would think of it. <span class='_quotespan'>Bob would want it this way</span>. Think of how many times you have said, <span class='_quotespan'>I am pretty sure that Bob is not going tot like it!</span> You can&rsquo;t make a decision without considering Bob. <span class='_quotespan'>How else would the system work? Things would not work without Bob.</span> That&rsquo;s what constantly happens in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. You do what you do <em>because of Bob</em>.</p>
 </p>

<h1>Rules, Laws, and Force</h1>
 <p>Rules, followed by convention, eventually turn into laws which <em>you are forced to follow.</em></p>
 <p>If you don&rsquo;t, you get a ticket. If you feel that&rsquo;s an injustice, you let it go to court, another type of force. If they rule in your behalf, you celebrate; if they don&rsquo;t, you are angry. All minor force.</p>
 <p>If you happen to be from the edge, it may get ugly and end up in prison time for you. A not so minor force.</p>
 <p>In prison you end in a fight and you end up maimed or dead. Definitely a <em>force majeure</em>.</p>

<h1>Capital and Contributions</h1>
 <p></p>

<h1>The Book</h1>
 <p>In the remainder of this book we are going to take it one theme are a time and compare how it works in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and how it would work in a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>
 <p>Even if you already see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> and its consequences, it might be worth skimming it to not get caught by surprise when the questions come (and keep coming).</p>
