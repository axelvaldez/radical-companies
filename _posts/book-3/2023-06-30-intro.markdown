<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>This book is for people who don&rsquo;t quite see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. Rather, they want to see it Fia<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>t with their Fiat glasses on. <span class='_quotespan'>sounds interesting&hellip; tell me more about about it,</span> say you as you cross your arms and lean back on your comfortable chair.</p>
 <p>If that is you, return this book. Sorry we confused you.</p>

<h1>Fiat?</h1>
 <p>Fiat is an Italian automobile brand; it stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino.</em></p>
 <p>Fiat is also a word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so</span. </em></p>
