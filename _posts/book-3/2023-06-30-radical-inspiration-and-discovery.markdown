 <p>This booklet is for people who don&rsquo;t quite see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. They want to, but they don&rsquo;t yet see it.</p>
</div>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
 <p>You are about to learn about an alternative way, where traditional boundaries crumble. Be ready for a journey that will challenge the status quo, spark your imagination, and leave an indelible mark on the world.

<h1>Alternatives</h1>
 <p>If you are feeling overwhelmed by work, it is not a matter of working harder. That is what your boss tells you, and even your well-meaning co-workers. That is what every business book says, to search for excellence,  acquire new habits to move up, do more with less effort. But it is not you, but the system that we call <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>.</p>
 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is designed to create more wealth for the owners and investors of the business you work for.</p>
 <p>The thing is that we created it, and we can create an alternative system, an alternative way of living.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Curing&rdquo; the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system would be never ending, because the system is too easy to game, particularly by powerful people. It adapts to fixes very fast.</p>
 <p>Beware that alternatives to <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> are fundamentally different and will feel alien, idealistic, and even crazy. It will take more courage than you can imagine.</p>

<h1>Fiat?</h1>
 <p>You don&rsquo;t see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>; you may not even know what the heck <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> means. But there is something, a feeling you have, that tells you that the system you and I live in is not quite right. And, you are correct in that it is not quite right. Perhaps you are spending too much time at work. Or you are always on call, so to speak, ready to travel to a last-minute destination. Or maybe you have to do what would be three days&rsquo; worth of work in two, or one, hoping for an attaboy and maybe a reward. <span class='_quotespan'>Don't worry, you will get a chance to rest when you get back,</span> but then you get back to a bigger pile of work.</p>
 <p>Maybe you are fully aware of this or maybe you think that this is our destiny. But it is not &ldquo;our destiny&rdquo;, it is not living.</p>
 <p>We want to help you see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> and how it is causing the way you feel.</p>

<h1>What Does Fiat Even Mean?</h1>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>But <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> it&rsquo;s a car.</span> And it is an Italian automobile brand that stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino.</em> Thus the acronym, FIAT.</p>
 <p>But what does <em>the word</em> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> mean?</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> money, for example, is worth what each nation says it is. Money used to be an equivalent to gold, but that stopped in the 70s. Now it is <span class='_quotespan'>because the country says so (and nominally its economy).</span>.</p>
 <p>In the context of giving orders, the phrase additionally carries an implied threat: <span class='_quotespan'>or else.</span></p>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>Move those boxes over there</span> because I say so,&hellip; or else.</span></p>

<h1>The Fiat System</h1>
 <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> environment, or more accurately, a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <em>system</em>. Some people <em>do not</em> like the word <em>system</em> associated with their lives, and that is understandable. <span class='_quotespan'>My life is not limited by a system, I shape it however I want to.</span> However, you and I live within a system that has been evolving for quite a while.</p>
 <p>We created the system and we maintain it. You have a boss, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. You work for a wage, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. And within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, you produce wealth for the business you work for, not for yourself. These are a elements of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system that we created, we live in, and we uphold.</p>
 <p>Worse, the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is based on competition, not collaboration. It based on dividing people, not bringing them together. It is based on threats, fear, force, and pain. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system does not work for the majority of us and even the wealthiest people.</p>
 <p>Luckily, there are alternatives to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>

<h1>It Starts with Rules</h1>
 <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Drug addicts were at the edge, too.</p>
 <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to a pre-school. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotespan'>did you hit him back harder</span>) and learn new ones (<span class='_quotespan'>keep your hands to yourself</span>).</p>
 <p>Lucky that we are, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. <span class='_quotespan'>That will be on the test!</span> In primary school, too, is when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <img
    src='/assets/img/pic-fiat-not-fiat-glass.svg'
    width='70%'
    alt=''>
  </div>
 <p>If we happen to be live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simple fiddling with them and learning to make them more comfortable. No matter, we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off. We want to stay away from the people who don't know how to wear the glasses correctly.</p>
 <p>Finally, we go to work, with our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and how to be a good worker.  We are happy to be a resource and happier that we are getting a steady wage (until, surprise, we are not).</p>
 <p>We learn to be kind and condescending to the ones whose glasses are skewed and not fitting correctly. <span class='_quotespan'>We do our best for these people, but they just don&rsquo;t want to learn the rules.</span> They want to live in the edge.</p>
 
<h1>The Fiat System Is&hellip;</h1>
 <p>That is what <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <strong>system</strong> is,
  <ul>
   <li>Learning the rules,</li>
   <li>Following the rules,</li>
   <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Think of what happens <em>when you get caught</em> not following the rules.<a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Think of how many decision you have made, now think of how you considered in the back of your head what your boss would think of it. Think of how many times you have said, <span class='_quotespan'>I am pretty sure that Bob is not going tot like it!</span> You can&rsquo;t make a decision without considering Bob.</p>
 <p>You may be thinking, <span class='_quotespan'>How else would the system work? Things would not work without Bob.</span> That&rsquo;s part of what we learn as we grow up in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. It is Bob or chaos. You do what you do because of Bob, the boss.</p>
 </p>

<h1>The Booklet</h1>
 <p>The rest of the booklet takes it one theme are a time. It then compares how it works in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and how it would work in a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. Because I am describing a system, you may find the booklet repetitive.</p>
 <p>Even if you already see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> and its consequences, it might be worth skimming through the booklet not to be surprised when you tried to explain it to somebody else and the questions come (and keep coming).</p>

<h1 class='_section'>Themes</h1>

<h1>Rules, Laws, and Force</h1>
 <p>Rules, followed by convention, eventually turn into <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> laws which you are <em>forced</em> to follow,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You  get a ticket. A very minor form of force. You have to give up money (<em>i.e.</em>, coined force) to be spared the pain that would follow if you don&rsquo;t.</li>
   <li>If you feel that is an injustice, you let it go to court (<em>i.e.</em>, another type of force).</li>
   <li>If they rule in your behalf, you celebrate because you won, the force is with you. If they don&rsquo;t, you are angry and you have to pay the ticket. Still minor force.</li>
   <li>On the other hand, if you happen to be from the edge, it may get ugly and you may end up in prison.<a href='#en02'><sup id='bm02'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> No longer a minor force.</li>
   <li>In prison you end, say, in a fight and you are maimed or killed or vice versa. Either way, it is definitely a <em>force majeure</em>.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Force is ever present in out <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. It goes from a frown to the electric chair. Withholding a prize because you did not say or did what was expected of you is a form of force. Getting passed over for a raise or promotion is a form of force. Firing you or laying you off is a form of force. Raising you rent so your only option is to leave is a form of force. We are surrounded by a system that runs on theats to actual pain (<em>i.e.</em>, force).</p>
 <p>Motivation is another form of force. <span class='_quotespan'>Do this and you&rsquo;ll get the reward.</span> We often don&rsquo;t realize that is coming from somebody else and we call it motivation. But you are being &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; to do what somebody else wants, regardless of you may want to do. That is force.</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>In an alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system there is no do-it-or-else force. This goes againt the myth that without <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> force we would never do anything of significance, we would never do anything bigger than ourselves.</p>
 <p>But considere that humanity managed to survive as a species. We invented agriculture. Agriculture spread to all corners of the earth. We managed to do all that and more without anybody telling us how to do it.<p>
 <p>Then came the people who took things by force, because they had nothing to trade but force. And then came money, coinage which allowed them to trade the wealth that they extracted from you by force. And slowly by surely the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system took shape around us.</p>
 <p>Then came the stories that supported it,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>An all powerful supernatural being at the top</li>
   <li>Paradise</li>
   <li>Eve as the bad apple</li>
   <li>Homosexuality and shellfish as abominations.</li>
   <li><span class='_quotespan'>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.</span><a href='#en03'><sup id='bm03'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></li>
  </ul>
 <p>Most insidious of all, we learn to expect that the fruit of our work should go to someone else,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A god, the omnipotent being at the top</li>
   <li>The boss.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>And that we get paid what the boss says it is reasonable.</p>
 <p>It didn&rsquo;t start this way, but it evolved. First came prisoners of minor wars, that were made to carry whatever the winners didn&rsquo;t want to carry. At the end they either joined the winners (after all, they were related) or they went back to their village. Then came slavery, they kept you as a worthless worker because they had the force (and you were not related). Finally came wage work. This is the general direction of the evolution, from forced labor by sheer force to forced labor by coin. Different forms of force, but force throughout.</p>
 <p>In the Fiat system &ldquo;being a good worker&rdquo; is a sign of pride today. There is nothing strange about it, it is normal. The alternative is chaos, to be avoided at all costs. Anybody talking alternatives (you and I) must be crazy.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Organized religion has been part of the support system as well, but before we talk about that, we have to talk about divide-and-conquer.</p>

<h1>Countries and Other Divisions</h1>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>Countries are <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> creations, straight out of kingdoms that were mostly nations or were cleansed by force.</p>
  <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to the Americas, they cleansed most of their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act as Catholics and speak Castillian (or else). In fact, the Inquisition made sure that the converted were truly convicing Catholics and spoke the language of the Church.</p>
  <p>By the time they got to the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla had developed a methodology to cleanse whatever other cultures they encountered.</p>
  <table class='_center, _h2table'>

    <th>Divide and Conquer</th>
    <td>
     <p>At some point women were made the property of men and were made subservient to them. That is, for example, why inhereted last names are the man&rsquo;s. The &ldquo;ez&rdquo; at the end of Spanish nanes is the equivalent to the &ldquo;apostrophe s&rdquo; in Enghlish, &ldquo;the property of.&rdquo; <span class='_quotespan'>Men were the kings of their castle</span> and women were chattel.</p>
     <p>It all was bundled with a strong ideology that created an institution and women became pillars of it. <span class='_quotespan'>Eve was the bad apple,</span> and she had better submit for salvation. And women covered their hair and wore burkas as a matter of duty.</p>
     <p>As Christianity spread at the spear-end of colonization, non-Europeans were made subservient to Europeans. Of course, there were wealthy non-Europeans and poor non-Europeans. The wealthier was treated better and oftentimes put in charge.</p>
     <p>We are still struggling with that attitude today, thousands of years later. <span class='_quotespan'>We could be in paradise, but the woman enticed us to bite the apple of knowledge and poisoned us.</span></p>

     <p>The Jewish tradition, Christianity, and Islam have an eternal boss named God. All powerful, at the top. You would dare to even think of equitable to such power, you can only submit to God.</p>
     <p>In Christianity, the Pope is the only one that could understand what God meant with his signs.</p>

 <h2>Non-Fiat</h2>
  <p>In an alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, there is no imposed hierarchy. If you believe in supernatural beings, so be it, but the story of the omnipotent boss at the top doesn&rsquo;t work anymore; in fact, that particular believe works against our survival as a species.</p>
  <p>The alternative is not chaos, but it is certainly different,</p>

<h1>Capital and Contributions</h1>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world we live in, the default is that the only way to contribute to a business is to invest capital in it. Said capital investment gives the investors power over the business. In the US investors don&rsquo;t have any power over company operations, but they can replace the CEO. And they can keep replacing him until they find one that runs the operations according to their wishes. Those are some of the side-effect of seeing capital as the only way to contribute.</p>
  <p>For one, power is force. So investors have power over the business.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, you have no ownership in the business. You are happy to get your salary, but that&rsquo;s that. Owners have power over you.</p>
 <h2>Non-Fiat</h2>
  <p>This is probably the most shocking thing about non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> alternatives: companies are not there to make founders and investors wealthy. Companies have to make money and be self-sustainable. But what usually goes into the pocket of the owners, now goes into the pockets of the co-owners, into the pockets of everybody who contributes to creating the wealth. If you are looking for yet another way to become wealthy, this ain&rsquo;t it. Companies are way to increase the wellbeing of every co-owner and the society around then.</p>
  <p>Your level of co-ownership is determined by these contributions given to you by your co-owner peers. You recognized contributions determines your level of co-ownership <em>that month.</em> Next month it will most likely be different.</p>

     <th>But&hellip;</th>
     <td>
      <p>At this point you may be coming up with objections, <span class='_quotespan'>Yeah, but it can be easily gamed: I&rsquo;ll give you all my <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s and you give me all of yours.</span> And yes, it could, but only if the other co-owners do not say anything about. Because of &ldquo;Transparency,&rdquo; they can see all the transactions and it is up to the co-owners to say or do something. They can have a conversation with people who seem to be trying to game the process. If they do not change their behavior, co-owners can decide to not recognize any of their contributions because they are doing something that make co-ownership a joke.</span></p>
      <p>Another objection might be that people won&rsquo;t want to take the time to recognize contributions. They may do it at first, but then they will stop. Again, the data is there for all to see and if all co-owners stop recognizing contributions, then they won&rsquo;t get any more co-ownership, including the take of the revenue. They may slow down until they see the result and then, I hope, they will go back to doing it. If not, the company will fall apart. On the way to a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> alternative things won&rsquo;t go perfect or smoothly. There will be plenty of bumps along the way. The &rdquo;fix&ldquo; is not to elect a boss to tell us what to do, the &rdquo;fix&ldquo; is to fix what is in your hands&mdash;you are all co-owners.</p>
      <p>An objection that I heard more than once is that <em>other</em> people are coin operated. They do not want to do anything for a community of society. My usual retort is, <span class='_quotespan'>what about family?</span> The thing is that <em>homo economicus</em> is one of those convenient stories that popped up to support the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. People have to survive and they will go to kinds of length to do it, but survival, though necessary, is not living.</p>

The PRI is paid back by the revenue each co-owner gets given their <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s. Until it is paid in full, what a co-owner takes of out of the PRI fund is a personal debt. Once the PRI fund is paid, the upside that would normally (dividends) go to the owners and investors goes to the co-owners according to their <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s.</p>

      <p>But what about investing in the future? Owners don&rsquo;t put all the profits in the pocket, they invest it!</p>
      <p>Indeed they do and co-owners can do the same. I make a distinction between profits and dividends, and the latter is what is left after paying all expenses, <em>including any investments</em>. For example, if the co-owners want to buy a $5M building, they would put up a <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> to accumulate that amount. They could decide to commit enough into the <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> to build up to $5M in three years. That amount is not be included in the dividends.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, all co-owners may not agree to commit any particular amount. In that case, the <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> would be funded by a subset of co-owners and when the building is bought the monthly rent would go to them according to their investment.</p>

<h1>Fiat and Radical</h1>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is a complex and complicated system. <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> is a simple <span class='_paradigm'>Foundation</span></p>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>I have already said a lot about <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. One thing I mentioned in passing is that <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> evolved into the complex mess it is today. Rules and laws morphed to adapt to their environment. For example, whereas the Christian Bible was admonishing slaves to &ldquo;obey your earthly masters&rdquo; that stopped being acceptable language in the lates 1800s (though women and children still had to obey their earthly master).</p>
  <p>The thing that has remained throughout is <span class='_paradigm'>Force.</span></p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <img
     src='/assets/img/pic-fiat-fear-force-or-pain.svg'
     width='70%'
     alt=''>
   </div>
  <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model and its embedded force is at the root of all govenance, from democracies to the dictatorships. Can you think of a decentralized national government? I can&rsquo;t, either, because it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
 <h2>Radical</h2>
  <p>As opposed to <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>, <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> is a <span class='_paradigm'>Foundation</span>, not an evolved system (<em>i.e.</em>, in yellow, below). <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> does not have embedded rules and it is not dogmatic in any way,</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <img
     src='/assets/img/pic-the-radical-model-coming-together.svg'
     width='70%'
     alt=''>
   </div>
  <p>We get often lost in the intellectual weeds and never discover the really toxic. The <span class='_paradigm'>Radical Foundation</span> helps us remain clear,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Will this decision make us more or less decentralized. Either choice is up to you and your community, but the <span class='_paradigm'>Foundation</span> helps you know which direction the decision is taking you.</li>
    <li>Will this decision make it easier to help people find meaning in what they are doing or not. Again, either choice is up to you and your community, but the <span class='_paradigm'>Foundation</span> helps you know where you are headed.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>You may be leaning one way, but rethink it once you realize where it would take you. What you definitely will not be able to do is hide behind, <span class='_quotespan'>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know!</span></p>
  <p><span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> doesn&rsquo;t come with rules out of the box, but you and the community of people you work with gets to come up witgh the rules. You are all co-owners.</p>

<h1>Competition and Collaboration</h1>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>Competition is another constant feature of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model. We learn to compete from the minute we are born. Kindergarten slows it down a little, but it comes back in full force in everything that follows. We pretend to listen, but we are really waiting our chance to outcompete the previous speakers. Sometimes we are aggressive and sometimes we are meek, but underneath it all we compete in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. There are even debate clubs where we can practive our competitive skills.</p>
  <p>And, <span class='_quotespan'>so?</span>, you ask, <span class='_quotespan'>what is wrong with that. We need to compete to survive.</span> But I see it as a way to divide people, as in divide and conquer. They who win and they who lose. In the Parlamentary system a specific political party may not win so they have to lump itno coaliations and then proceed to the sausage-making room where they come up with Minister of this and Minister of that. This makes it a lot easier for the powerful to just pay off enough of the winners.</p>
  <p>Democracy-by-voting is the best 18<sup>th</sup> century system we have, but we are in 21<sup>st</sup> century now.</p>

 <h2>Radical</h2>
  <p>Competition  is a way of imposing your will. Cooperation is how you negotiate your will. Collaboration is the way to come up with what acceptable to (most) everyone. The people who can&rsquo;t live with it, have to come up with their own proposal. BTW, this is called <em>consent</em> by Sociocracy practioners and as far as I know, they came up with it.</p>
