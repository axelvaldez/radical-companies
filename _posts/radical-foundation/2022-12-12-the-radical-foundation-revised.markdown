<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Foundation can be made a bit simpler and more focused.</p>
 <p>In the book <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL COMPANIES</span>, we described the Foundation like this,</p>
 <table align="center">
  <tr style="_background">
   <th>principles</th>
   <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>

  <tr>
   <td class="_spacer"></td>

   <th>commitments</th>
   <td>Transparency & Decentralization</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

 </table>
 <p>At pivotal points, having a Foundation helps you get oriented along the path you have chosen. <span class="_quotespan">Will this action help us to develop and grow as people?</span> <span class="_quotespan">Will this decision make us more centralized or more decentralized?</span> <span class="_quotespan">Are we being too rigid or are we still learning from experimentation?</span></p>

<h1>Meaning and Belonging</h1>
 <p>Meaning and Belonging cannot be separated. <em>Belonging</em> is key to <em>Meaning</em> to the individual, but it is something we get primarily from others in the community we that we are part of. If I make a spear to fish, it becomes significant to myself next time I am hungry and I eat the fish that I caught with my spear. But when I see <em>somebody else</em> make a spear like mine to fish, that is when my spear, my expression, becomes a contribution!</p>
 <p>Rather than &ldquo;principles,&rdquo; this sould relabled &ldquo;people&rdquo; to make it super-obvious that <em>people</em> are the basis of it all.</p>

<h1>Decentralization & Transparency</h1>
 <p>Decentralization and Transparency are somewhat redundant.</p>
 <p>At the completely decentralized end everything will be 100% transparent. Completely decentralized means complete transparency.</p>
 <p>On the way to full decentralization you may consider keeping some things secret. The person charged with keeping them would be the boss of those secrets. The questions, then, would be,<span class="_quotespan">Who is going to be the boss of these secrets?</span> No matter if this is a very nice person, or a small, trusted committee with a term limit: so long as there are secrets, there is a boss.</p>
 <p>Even though these are redundant, I feel we need to make them both explicit. Sometimes we think we are decentralizing but when we look at the Transparency side we see incoherence. So,although decentralization implies transparency, we need both to keep us honest.</p>

<h1>Explicit Alignment & Experimentation</h1>
 <p>Finally, we come to a leg of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> foundation that needs to be changed.</p>
 <p>I was never very happy with the combination of <em>Explicit Alignment</em> and <em>Experimentation</em> under Practices. I have now realized that Explicit Alignment is a tool &ndash; one that we believe is key and absolutely necessary, but it&rsquo;s just a tool.</p>
 <p>Experimentation, on the other hand, applies to every <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> practice. The result may or may not meet our expectations (<em>i.e.</em>, our hypothesis), but even when it does not, it serves to teach us a lesson and we learn.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>
 <p>Toos are not technically a part of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> foundation itself; you can be on the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> path and use diffferent tools. No matter, this is what we&rsquo;ve come up with, so far,</p>
