 <p>It is simple: avoid risks or risk it. Run away or go for it. Lecture or learn. Fear or love.</p>

<h1>Risk Life or Preserve It</h1>
 <p>Unicellular bacteria have this wired into them. <span class="_quotespan">Hmm&hellip; nourishment, go after it!</span> <span class="_quotespan">Hmm&hellip; poison, run away from it!</span></p>
 <p>Risk or preserve life: the rule of all live creatures.</p>

<h1>Frozen by Fear or Guided by Love?</h1>
 <p>We people show up in the tree of life with all shades of fear and a whole range of love.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_h2table">
   <tr>
    <th style="width:50%; ">Fear is a very strong, life-preserving feeling. Under the right circumstances, and speaking from experience, the sound of bullets can make you forget your loved ones and run for cover.</th>
    <td>Love is also very strong, too, but fear is stronger.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Fear hurts.</th>
    <td>Love doesnâ€™t.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Fear hurts not only you, but those around you as well.</th>
    <td>Love, on the other hand, uplifts me, you, and those around you.</td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </div>
 <p>I prefer to be guided by love, not fear. I prefer the kind that leads with trust, the kind that tries to understand the feelings behind the words said.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
