 <p>It is simple: avoid risks or risk it. Run away or go for it. Lecture or learn. Fear or love.</p>

<h1>Risk Life or Preserve It</h1>
 <p>Unicellular bacteria have this wired into them. <span class="_quotespan">Hmm&hellip; nourishment, go after it!</span> <span class="_quotespan">Hmm&hellip; poison, run away from it!</span></p>
 <p>Risk or preserve life: the rule of all live creatures.</p>

<h1>Frozen by Fear or Guided by Love?</h1>
 <p>We people show up in the tree of life with all shades of fear and a whole range of love: erotic, brotherly, impersonal, interpersonal, agape.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

 <p>I prefer to be guided by love. The kind that leads with trust. The kind that tries to understand the feelings behind the words said.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>Being guided by love is good for my wellbeing, yours, and others around me.</p>
