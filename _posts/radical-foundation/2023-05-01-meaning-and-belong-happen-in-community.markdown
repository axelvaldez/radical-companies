 <p>Meaning & Belonging only happen in communities. The opposite, and what&rsquo;s happening a lot, is isolation.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Meaning & Belonging only happen in communities. Transformations only happen in community. Changing your mindset is key, but you need other people you have changed their mindset as well. <span class="_quotespan">If you want to go quick, go alone. If you want to go far, go together,</span> ypu will need like-minded companions for the journey.</p>
 <p>That is, too, what diversity is all about,
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>&hellip; not just ethnic diversity, not cultural diversyty, not just econmic diverstiy &hellip; Everyone. Everyone&rsquo;s voices.</p>

<h1>Isolation</h1>
 <p>The opposite is isolation, which, I&rsquo;d say, we now have too much of. It is down to individuals and our society is going to pay the price.</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>Loneliness is more than just a bad feeling. When people are socially disconnected, their risk of anxiety and depression increases. So does their risk of heart disease (29%), dementia (50%), and stroke (32%). The increased risk of premature death associated with social disconnection is comparable to smoking daily&mdash;and maybe even greater than the risk associated with obesity.</p>

 </div>
 <p>But isolation of groups into <em>competing silos</em> is fundamental to <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> culture. Divide and conquer! The more groups compete with each other, the lesser chance that they will get together to fight the things that really hurts them and holds back society, like <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> ownership.</p>
