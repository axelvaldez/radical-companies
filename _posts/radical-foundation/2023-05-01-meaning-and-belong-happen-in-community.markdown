 <p>Meaning & Belonging only happen in communities. Transformations only happen in community. Changing your mindset is key, but you need other people you have changed their mindset as well. <span class="_quotespan">If you want to go quick, go alone. If you want to go far, go together,</span> ypu will need like-minded companions for the journey.</p>
 <p>That is, too, what diversity is all about,
