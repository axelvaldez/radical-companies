 <p>Here is the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Foundation,</p>
 <div class="_center">

 <p>And the comment was, <span class="_quotespan">Do you have to do everything at once? Why can&rsquo;t you start with Meaning and Belonging?</span></p>
 <p>The answer is that you don&rsquo;t have to do anythingk that you don&rsquo;t want to. You do have to work on all three legs of the foundation to be on the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> path.</p>
 <p>No matter, <em>Meaning & Belonging</em>, without <em>Transparency & Decentralization</em>, and <em>Experimentation</em>, is what paternalistic businesses are.</p>

<h1>Time to Run</h1>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">We are a family!</span>; You should hear that as, <span class="_quotespan">Time to get out of here!</span></p>
 <p>Meaning & Belonging, without Decentralization, Transparency, and Experimentation, is what paternalistic businesses are all about. You feel comfortable, with friends. They send you flowers when you are sick. They even bring you soup when you are under the wheather. But in the end, you are working for a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business whose sole purpose is to add to the owner&rsquo;s wealth. And if it means havgin to fire you, they will regret doing so, but they will.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> foundation is three-legged people, commitments, and practics. Paternalistic businesses are very good at the <em>people</em> piece. On the other hand, it is very centralized on the owners. Transparency takes a hit, too, for the sake of protecting their people, <span class="_quotespan">Why bother my people with all the details, all they need to know&hellip; ,</span> what I say they need to know. Like I said, they are very paternalisctic.</p>
 <p>In a paternalistic businesses there is no need for experiementation. You simply have to do what the owner says. And don&rsquo;t deviate from what he said to do or how he said to do it, or you will get a scolding. &ldquo;We are here to work, not play games.&rdquo;</p>
 
<h1>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Path</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> foundation is three-legged for a reason and to get <em>and</em> stay on the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> path, you need to work on <em>all three</em> legs of it.</p>
