<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Instead of giving a deadline, the team can agree to a regular &ldquo;status&rdquo; meeting.</p>
 <p>Say it is a Wednesday morning, instead of saying, <span class='_quotespan'>it will take me two day,</span> say <span class='_quotespan'>can we have a status meeting on Friday at 4 pm.</span></p>
 <p>Deadlines are a form of control, of force. What we want is to learn if we can help anybody in team. In Radical-base company force does not have a place.</p>
