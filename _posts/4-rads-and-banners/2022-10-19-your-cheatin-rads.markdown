<h1>To Mend a Broken Heart</h1>
 <p>What happens when two or more people give each other all their <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s?</p>
 <p style="text-indent:0; ">Transparency happens!</p>
 <p style="text-indent:0; ">When they see it, it is up to co-owners to bring up this and any other suspicious behavior <em>with the people involved</em>. It will take new skills to bring this up in a curious, non-accusatory way, but it is a skill worth learning. After all, there might be a good reason for this suspicious-looking event.</p>

<h1>Love</h1>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>Hey, how come you have been giving each other 100% of your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s?</span></p>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>Don&rsquo;t you know what&rsquo;s happening outside your team? Aren&rsquo;t you curious?</span></p>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>It is good to take time to observe all the life that&rsquo;s going on around you. Maybe you&rsquo;ll find contributions there.</span></p>
