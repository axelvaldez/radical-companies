 <p>Unpolished thoughts about national governments in a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> world.</p>
</div>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
 <p>In the book RADICAL COMPANIES: Without Bosses or Employees,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> we considered how the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model would work in a company environment, but we said next to nothing about money<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>, land<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>, or government.</p>
 <p>In <span class="_paradigm">rCoin: Decentralized Mingtin</span>, I laid out my ideas about money and what it would look like in a decentralized, transparent world. In <span class="_paradigm">rLand</span></a>, I put down my thoughts on how land would be handled in a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> world. In this document I finally get to lay down some my thoughts, albeit unpolished, about government.</p>

<h1>Very Different</h1>
 <p>National governments are the ultimate centralized power. Dictatorships are the most centralized, and democratic governments the least, but they all centralize power. They have a monopoly on force. The US national government run the military, state governments and cities run police forces, and then there is Reserves.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model, governments would not be able to collect taxes since the moral equivalent of land taxes go directly into local community funds and only a trickle of it goes to more centralized centers of power.</p>
 <p>In any case, in the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model society&rsquo;s governance would be decentralized and not like today. <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> governance will be not based competition as it is in the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system.</p>

<h1>City Government</h1>
 <p>A local government must be granted power by the State. This is probably a leftover from the days of Royalty, where the ruler had to issue a charter (and charged for doing so).</p>
 <p>City governments are responsible for,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The police force, fire abatement, paramedic help.</li>
   <li>Traffic infrastructure (<em>e.g.</em>, signs, speed zones).</li>
   <li>Local city road construction and maintenance, including public parking for cars and motorcycles.</li>
   <li>Building regulations and zoning.</li>
   <li>Keeping water clean and maintaining sewer lines.</li>
   <li>Waste removal.</li>
   <li>Parks and recreation.</li>
   <li>Municipal courts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Another thing that our present day&rsquo;s cities get involved in is economic development. Let&rsquo;s start with that because that is where the wheels of &ldquo;government of the people, by the people, for the people&rdquo; start to come off.</p>
  <h2>Economic Development</h2>
   <p>&ldquo;Economic development&ldquo; is where elected government goes over the line and gets involved in the creation of private goods for businesses and their owners in the name of &ldquo;job creation.&rdquo; In a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> world, city governments are no longer responsible for any of this&mdash;everybody is capable and has the means to build their own wealth creating communities.</p>
   <p>TEST 3</p>
   <div class="_center">
    <table class="_h2table">
      <tr>
       <th>Car Traffic</th>
       <td>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s take traffic next. I predict that all things traffic are going to change dramatically, very quickly. As I write this, CRUISE<a href="#en05"><sup id="bm05">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> launched a driverless, Uber-like service in San Francisco. It won&rsquo;t take long before its price comes down to the point that it will not make sense for individuals to own cars, and house cars, and loiter the streets with parked cars. Eventually, a car can own itself. Autonomous cars will house themselves out of sight throughout an urban area and there  won&rsquo;t be cars parked on the side of roads, and.</p>
        <p>The next development is to have intra-vehicle communication. With that and the sensor in every vehicle, we won&rsquo;t need traffic lights or signage.</p>
        <p>So, take all things traffic off the city&rsquo;s todo list.</p>
       </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <th>Infrastructure</th>
       <td>
        <p>Local city road construction and maintenance remains a task that somebody has to be responsible for, at least, coordinating. Imagine a company whose &ldquo;product&rdquo; is the public good, with expertise of where the roads are needed, and whose &ldquo;performance&rdquo; would then be measured via RADs.</p>
       <p>The actual construction of the roads would be 1) funded by the community that needs it and 2) built by companies that have expertise in doing so and are highly valued by the communities that finance them (again, as measured by RADs).</p>
       <p>Parks and recreation are very similar, with people responsible for <em>coordinating</em> planning and construction. Ditto for water purification.</p>
       <p>What else?</p>
       </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <th>Zoning and Building Regulations</th>
       <td>
        <p>Zoning strikes me as a weak way to try and control the worst tendencies of FIAT landowners. But keeping the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; buildings away from the residential buildings is not harmless. And it is not a solution, either. I&rsquo;d rather trust each hyper-local community, people who know each other, to make those decisions using the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> system rather than a city government.</p>
        <p>There might be a coordinating function needed as well as expertise but that can be handled by <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies.</p>
        <p>Off the list.</p>
       </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <th>Higiene: Waste Removal</th>
       <td>
        <p>City governments already contract with private companies to do the removal work. Individual <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> communities can do this easily, with transparency providing the coordinating function.</p>
       </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <th>Municipal Courts</th>
       <td>
        <p>&ldquo;Crime&rdquo; in a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> community would be the exception and probably driven by mental imbalances that would be better taken care of by communities with the help of people who specialize in this kind of situation.</p>
        <p>Disputes could mostly be handled by the communities itself, with the help of people who specialize in this kind of situation.</p>
       </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <th>Police, Fire, Paramedic</th>
       <td>
        <p>The first thing to note about the police is that it is <em>a force</em>, carrying lethal weapons. They <em>fight</em> criminals, people who don&rsquo;t abide by the rules and would harm the rest of us, well behaved citizens. We want them to do a lot besides that: caretakers and givers, arbiters, the calmest person in the room and the most aggressive person in the room. In the face of all these conflicting roles, they often default to the threat of violence and violence itself. I doubt that there&rsquo;d be a need for specialized police—people would do most of it—but even if there is, it would be very different than it is today.</p>
        <p>Fire abatement has been around for a long time. At the beginning putting out fires was a paid <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business, &ldquo;you have to pay before we put out the fire.&rdquo; Eventually it became a public service. I imagine that fire abatement, paramedics, and disaster help would all come as a service paid for Banners.</p>
       </td>
      </tr>
     </table>
    </div>

<h1>County Government</h1>
 <p>These take care of school districts independent of cities. They also handle many city-like functions for unincorporated areas.</p>

<h1>State Government</h1>
 <p>The main function of State government seems to be standing in the way of what progressive cities want to do or pushing conservative cities to do something they don&rsquo;t really want to. Other than that, they handle water harvesting and distribution, the State police, and its National Guard.</p>
 <p>Whatever we said about police, above, applies to the State police and National Guard.</p>
 <h2>Water: Urban vs Farm</h2>
  <p>Water is a good case to think through. Residential water versus irrigation water is a fight that has been going on in California for a long time. Central Valley versus coastal areas. Producers versus consumers. Talking points that go straight for the emotional buzzer. And really the whole thing is about who is going to rule water? The State government is lef&rsquo;s to compromise, either where nobody outright wins or the winner is obfuscated. That&rsquo;s the FIAT way.</p>
  <p>I haven&rsquo;t thought about what this would look like under a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model.</p>

<h1>National Government</h1>
 <p>I don&rsquo;t see any use for national governments, long term.</p>
 <p>Maybe, bigger things like the Space Station and planetary research may remain in the hands of a government-like team.</p>

<h1>Worth Repeating</h1>
 <p>This may be a difficult read and it may be worth repeating here a few words about the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> framework and how it&rsquo;s different from our current world. Probably the most confusing thing about it is that a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> world would be very similar to our current world. People will be the same with all our jealousies, overreactions, and habits. They will be embarrassed by overpromising and want to sweep under the proverbial rug.</p>
 <p>The only difference—the big difference—is that the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> system is centered around our interdependence.</p>
 <p>Our current system is based on separating us: countries, towns, good and bad neighborhoods; political parties and their vastly different realities; need to know, secrecy, protection. This leaves us disconnected and drives us to isolation. Businesses are built on creating platforms to bring us back together, for a fee. This works for a world where money comes first, ahead of everything else.</p>
 <p>A <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> world, too, is centered around accomplishments and real innovation, but it prioritizes what&rsquo;s important to people first, ahead of everything else, including money. We&rsquo;ll still be individuals, with our own needs, rights, and idiosyncrasies. We are not going to become a number. The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model is centered on trust, the type that comes from community and collaboration.</p>

<h1>The Three Branches</h1>
 <p>Throughout the stuff above, there is a general disregard for the separation of powers so central to democratic governments today. That system was designed as a confrontation which does not allow any party to achieve victory. Evern brand of government monitors and regulates the other branches. That was the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> solution to not having a King or Queen. Wild for the 18th century. Kind of like the Internet of its time.</p>
 <p>In a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> world, there would not be such a separation, although there might be in particular cases.</p>
 <h2>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Model</h2>
  <p>We are used to companies being governed by FIAT hierarchies, with an owner at the top sending down commands, via a hierarchy, that tell people <em>what</em> to do, <em>how</em> to do it, and <em>when</em> to do it. In this document, we assume a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> world that is, at the same time, alike and different from our world today.</p>
  <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model, a <em>company</em> is a group of people coming together to create something bigger than each of them. Other labels abound, but we chose the word &ldquo;company&rdquo; because it has an interesting genesis: it comes from the Latin <em>con-</em> and <em>pan</em>. The prefix <em>con-</em> means &ldquo;together, with&rdquo; and <em>pan</em> means &ldquo;bread, food.&rdquo; At its root, then, <em>company</em> means &ldquo;people who break bread together.&rdquo; In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model a company is a community of people who come together to contribute broad value to society and make an impact on the world.</p>
  <p>Rather than having an owner and a hierarchy of bosses, a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company has co-owners and co-managers to govern and operate it. These people align themselves according to the impact they want to make, why they are doing so, and then they embark on many experiments to get there.</p>

  <h2>Evolution, Interrupted</h2>
   <p>As I see it, the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model of co-ownership and co-management is the next stage in collaboration. Everything humanity has accomplished has been based on collaboration, but we have acted as if dominance by a few is the only way to achieve anything.<a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
   <p>The dominance model of collaboration has become an obstacle to real progress and it is now getting in the way of the next surge of human accomplishments. Now it&rsquo;s time to move on and build on the foundation of nterdependence towards a higher level of collaboration.</p>
