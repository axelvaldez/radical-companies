 <p>Government owns the military. It has a monopoly on force. Force to protect the country&rsquo;s borders. That&rsquo;s a nice story. But goverments is a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system.</p>
 <p>What people need, and always emerges, is governance. A way to make it easier to collaborate, to live and work together.</p>
 <p>You don't need governance if you are stranded in a small island by yourself. The only &lsquo;governance&rsquo; with the other animals in the island is force, <span class="_quotespan">You come near me and I will slaughter you.</span> But that doesn&rsquo;t work with people. With people you need governance, <span class="_quotespan">This is how we do things around here&hellip; This is how we collaborate to build a better life.</span> Governance is about collaborating to change those agreements, our ability to change the culture. And that is the point.</p>
 <p>Making up rules that others must follow is easy to do, but harder to implement. So, we use force to make sure they do, some form of punishment: penalties, court proceedings, prison. But doesn&rsquo;t work with people. It may contain them, the majority of them, for a long time, but it doesn&rsquo;t really work. In dictatorships, they only revolt with violence against those kinds of rules. In in places that lean towards democtracy, people also still revolt agains those kinds of rules but use less violent or non-violent ways, like assembling, protesting, and voting.</p>

<h1>Governance, Not Government</h1>
 <p>The distinction was not clear in my mind; actually, there was no distinction in my head, when I wrote <a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/05/rgov">rGov</a>,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> almost a year ago. In it I believe that governments would not exist at all because there would no borders, people could co-manage broad communities agreements, and I didn&rsquo;t have give any indication as to what we do instead of across-the-world agreements. I was missing governance, but the post should have been entitled Co-Gov.</p>
