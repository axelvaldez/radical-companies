 <p>Governments have a monopoly on force to protect the country&rsquo;s borders. That&rsquo;s a nice story. And then you remember that goverments are <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> institutions, based on dictatorships-known-as-businesses.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>What people need, and always emerges, is governance. A way to make it easier to collaborate, live together, and work together.</p>
 <p>You don't need governance if you are stranded in a small island by yourself. The only &lsquo;governance&rsquo; with the other animals in the island is force, <span class="_quotespan">You come near me and I will slaughter you.</span> But that doesn&rsquo;t work with people. With people you need governance, <span class="_quotespan">This is how we do things around here&hellip; This is how we collaborate to build a better life.</span> Governance is about collaborating to change those agreements, our ability to change the culture. And that is the point.</p>

<h1>Rules and Punishment</h1>
 <p>Making up rules that others must follow is easy to do, but harder to implement. So, we use some form of punishment, penalties, court proceedings, prison, for people who don&rsquo;t follow them rules. But that doesn&rsquo;t work. It may hold people back, or at least the majority of them, for a while, but that is it. In dictatorships, people revolt violently because that is what they know works. In places that lean towards democracy, people also revoltm, but use less violent or non-violent ways, like assembling, protesting, and voting.</p>

<h1>Governance, Not Government</h1>
 <p>when I wrote <a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/05/rgov">rGov</a>,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> almost a year ago there was no distinction in my mind between government and governance. I assumed that in a co-managed and co-owned world, governments would not exist; certainly not in their present form. There would no borders to defend and people could co-manage the rest.</p>
 <p>If I had not missed missing governance altogether, I would have entitled the post <a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/05/rgov">rGov Is Co-Gov</a> or something like that.</p>
