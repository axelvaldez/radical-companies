 <p>Government owns the military. It has a monopoly on force. Force to protect the country&rsquo;s borders. That&rsquo;s a nice story. But goverments is a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system.</p>
 <p>What people need, and always emerges, is governance. A way to make it easier to collaborate, to live and work together.</p>
 <p>You don't need governance if you are stranded in a small island by yourself. The only &lsquo;governance&rsquo; with the other animals in the island is force, <span class="_quotespan">You come near me and I will slaughter you.</span> But that doesn&rsquo;t work with people. With people you need governance, <span class="_quotespan">This is how we do things around here&hellip; This is how we collaborate to build a better life.</span> Governance is about collaborating to change those agreements, our ability to change the culture.</p>


 <p>A boss in the no-boss world.</p>
 <p>Reducing the force.</p>
