<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Shares in a <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> business come from capital. <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s come from recognized contributions.</p>
 <p>In <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> businesses, rights to dividens is based on capital investments and negotiations. In <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> companies, rights to dividends is based on contributions recognized by co-owners.</p>
</div>

<h1>Business Shares Are Static</h1>
 <p>When the <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> owner gives another investor 10% of the business in shares, that is forever. For example, Mark Zuckerberg owns 11% of Meta, forever. He can retire from the business now and he will still own 11% of Meta.</p>
 <p>Business shares are static.</p>

<h1><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s Are Dynamic</h1>
 <p>When co-owners give another co-owner 10% of the <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s, that percentage lasts for, say, a month. Next month the same co-owner may end up with 5% and the next with 20%. It depends on his contributions as recognized by other co-owners.</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are dynamic.</p>
