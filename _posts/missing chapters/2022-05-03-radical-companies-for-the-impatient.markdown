<div style="display:none;">
 <p>A short walk through co-management and co-ownership, the <span style="font-size: smaller; ">RADICAL</span> model. A short version of what appears in the book <em>RADICAL COMPANIES: Without Bosses or Employees</em>.</p>
</div>

<h1>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Model</h1>

 <h2>Businesses-as-Dictatorships Hurt Us</h2>
  <p>Our collapsing climate, the gaping wealth gap, discrimation, and exploitation are but a few of the inescapable side-effects of the system we live in. A system that &ldquo;divides, demonizes, and causes us to suspend our intincts toward better.&rdquo; <a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> But it has also brought us abundance and we don not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. What is clear is that we need a generative way of relating to one another, a different paradigm. As we see it, businesses are the place to start, transformed into companies they are the incubators for what comes next.</p>
  <p>Nature follows a simple path to create big beautiful things out of small, unpretentious ones. From a tiny seed to a mighty oak tree. We don&rsquo;t think that a long list of color scales or a 17-page constitution are necessary, or even helpful, to make a fundamental change. Eventually, these can become dogma, a form of force, and sabotage our progress. With that in mind, we came up with what we think is the simplest, most basic foundation to support our coming together to share work and wealth.</p>
 <h2><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Company Foundation</h2>
  <p>In <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> speak, a company is what we call a group of people who come together to build something bigger than themselves. In fact, the word &ldquo;company&rdquo; comes from the Latin <em>con-</em>, meaning &lsquo;together&rsquo;, and <em>pan</em>, meaning &lsquo;bread.&rsquo; In other words, people who break bread together.</p>
  <p>Every company is different because the people who embody it are different, and this means that every company must find its own way. What fundamentally makes a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company different from a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business is that it has a foundation,</p>
   <div class="_center">
    <table class="_h2table">
     <tr>
      <th>people</th>
      <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <th>commitments</th>
      <td>Decentralization & Transparency</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <th>practices</th>
      <td>Experimentation</td>
     </tr>
    </table>
   </div>
  <p>Other practices can be layered on top of these, but for a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company this foundation is essential, otherwise it is just a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business with ain&rsquo;t-we-nice sprinkled on top.</p>
  <p>Hierarchies don&rsquo;t just go away, but, unlike in a <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> business, a hierarchy is not imposed in a co-managed company. Hierarchies that do emerge are dynamic, fluid, and shaped by what&rsquo;s needed, at a particular time, by the people involved. &ldquo;An organism constantly changes. The cells develop, die and are replaced. It adapts to the current environment or goes away. &hellip; The org chart is insufficient.&rdquo; <a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

 <h2>Alignment Must Be Explicit and Transparent</h2>
  <p>In order to create a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company, you first need to be explicit about the company&rsquo;s IMPACT  (<em>i.e.</em>, <em>what for</em>), its PURPOSE (<em>i.e.</em> why), and MISSION (<em>e.g.</em>,its <em>what</em>, <em>how</em>, and <em>when</em>). You might call them something different or you might lump them in different ways, but, no matter, they have to be explicit and completely open and accessible to everyone.</p>
  <p>The three-finger Scout Salute <a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> is a good mnemonic for it,</p>
  <pre style="font-family: courier new; text-align: center; border: silver dotted 1px; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px; ">
   <img src="/assets/img/en-alignment.svg" alt="Three middle fingers up, as in the Scout Salute, serves as a mnemonic for the three elements of alignment: the middle finger stands for IMPACT, the index finger for PURPOSE, and the ring finger for MISSION" title="Elements of Alignment" style="width: 80%; ">
  </pre>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Impact is our beacon, a clear point of light just over the horizon that guides us. This is what many call Vision but we wanted to put more emphasis on the <em>impact</em> that vision will have on the world.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Dave Logan, lead author of <em>Tribal Leadership</em>, used to call it Noble Cause, but these days he prefers to call it Noble Passion. As he puts it, &ldquo;&hellip; a noble cause gets you out of bed. A noble passion gets you out of bed early and keeps you up late into the night.&rdquo; <a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Purpose is the reason why we, as a company, are focused on this particular Impact. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be world shaking and it doesn&rsquo;t have to strum your heart&rsquo;s strings. An effective Purpose must clearly express <em>why</em> it is important for others to join us in this adventure.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">The Mission defines <em>what</em> we are going to do to move towards the Impact, <em>how</em> we are going to do it, and by <em>when</em>. This is a live, dynamic conversation where everybody who wants to can participate. It is not "suggestions" sent by email to somebody else who is going to select by popularity or any such. And, yes, it scales: there are many ways to do it with 50, 1,00, or 10,000 people.</p>
   </li>
 </ul>
 <p>This is but one way to express alignment. The important thing is to make it explicit, simple, and meaningful to <em>everybody</em> in the team.</p>

<h1>Recognizing Contributions</h1>
 <p>The Distribution mechanism we describe below recognizes contributions, makes ownership decentralized and dynamic, supports egalitarian and equitable wealth sharing, and it scales to organizations of any size. <a href="#en05"><sup id="bm05">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

 <h2>The Rosedale Distribution</h2>
  <p style="margin-bottom:10px; ">Rosedale Distribution <a href="#en06"><sup id="bm06">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> is our name for a practice that we first heard from entrepreneur Philip Rosedale,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">As the company grows, cash and shares are put out for distribution every month.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Every member gets an equal portion of the wealth the company generated. But they don&rsquo;t get to keep these goodies for themselves: they have to distribute them to other members.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">They give it to anybody they feel has contributed the most during the month. Each person knows best who has meaningfully contributed.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Each person decides how much to give to whom based on whatever criteria &ldquo;feels right&rdquo; to them.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

 <h2>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL DISTRIBUTION</span></h2>
  <p>Instead of cash or stocks, <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL DISTRIBUTION</span> uses a dimensionless unit we call a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>. Whereas money has a <em>fixed</em> value, RADs <em>factor</em> value through them. Whereas stocks represent a fixed percentage of the company <em>forever</em>, <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s represent a dynamic <em>percentage</em> of ownership<em> at each cycle</em>.</p>
  <p>RADs represent any kind of contribution (<em>i.e.,</em> not just financial). In fact, as an accounting tool, <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s account for the unaccountable.</p>
  <p>Co-owners then get to distribute RADs according to their individual judgment. Each decides what is an <em>equitable</em> number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to give to other co-owners as recognition for their contributions. The value of the whole emerges from the judgment of the many.</p> 
  <p>A few important observations about <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>,
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;"><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are not a currency.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;"><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are issued even before there is revenue because contributions happen regardless of revenue.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">The giving criteria is completely up to each person, although we can agree to some explicit guiding criteria to start with. In any case, at every <span class="_paradigm">DISTRIBUTION RESTROSPECTIVE</span> new criteria are fleshed out and harvested to use as guidelines.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;"><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s represent <em>dynamic</em> ownership. One month you may give me all your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, but the next month you may not give me any.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">To calculate your percentage ownership, divide the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s you have been given by the total number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">The absolute number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s allocated to me either stays the same or goes up at every <span class="_paradigm">DISTRIBUTION</span>, but it never goes down. For example, if I had 100 <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s last cycle and I get 50 this cycle, my total number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s goes to 150. If I don&rsquo;t get any this cycle, my total number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s stays at 100.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">On the other hand, my <em>percentage</em> of the total could go up, stay the same, or go down at every <span class="_paradigm">DISTRIBUTION</span>. For example, if I get 100 <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s from a total of 1,000, then I have 10% of the total. If I get 50 <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s this cycle, I have 150 <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s and my percent ownership goes up to 12.5%. If, on the other hand, I get 20 new <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, my percentage stays at 10%. In the worst case, if I don&rsquo;t get any new <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, my percentage goes down to 8%.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">When money, or time, or whatever else is disbursed later, it is done as a function of the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s each person owns. For example, if you have accumulated 200 <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s and I have 100, then you&rsquo;ll get twice as much as me of whatever is being factored through the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Allocations work like this,
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Co-owners get to recognize contributions by pressing a button in the RADs! app. They can press this &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; button as many times as they <em>feel</em> like.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Co-owners get one <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> per day.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">At the end of the cycle, the number of recognitions you have given are divided by the total number of recognitions given by everybody during the cycle. By multiplying this percentage by the total number of RADs accumulated during the cycle, we get the number of RADs each persson gets.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Each member gets to recognize contributions as they see fit. For example, you may end up giving 50% of your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to Adrian, 33% to Jose, and 1.7% to me. This would allocate, roughtly, 15 <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to Adrian, 10 to Jose, and 5 to me.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">You may have <span class="_paradigm">DISTRIBUTION</span> events once a month, where everybody celebrates and give feedback.</p>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>

 <h2><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL DISTRIBUTION</span>s Are Scalable</h2>
  <p>People are the best judges of <em>what</em> a contribution is and <em>who</em> is making it and it doesn't take that many peole to cover the whole team. If somebody doesn't get any <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s at all, it's probably because he is totally disconnected or none of his work looks like contributions to however many people make up the company.</p>

   <p>As people share and grant each other <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, they learn the value of what they&rsquo;re building together at a visceral level. People will, by necessity, be encouraged to learn to communicate more and better (&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t bragging if you&rsquo;ve done it&rdquo; <a href="#en07"><sup id="bm07">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>). They will learn from their peers to value their own accomplishments. They will also learn to talk about their failures, what they&rsquo;ve learned from them, and how this learning can be valuable to others.</p>

 <h2><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL DISTRIBUTION</span>s Include <span class="_paradigm">RETROSPECTIVE</span>s</h2>
  <p>At a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL RETROSPECTIVE</span>, members discuss the criteria they used to allocate <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. Participation in these <span class="_paradigm">RETROSPECTIVE</span>s is voluntary and members can share as much or as little of their criteria as they like. These do not prevent people from making their own decisions, but it serves as a guide.</p>

 <h2><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL DISTRIBUTION</span>s Include Feedback</h2>
  <p>Anybody who wants to can call for a feedback session after a <span class="_paradigm">DISTRIBUTION</span>. In particular, people who didn&rsquo;t get anything or significantly less than they expected would want to do this. It might be difficult to hear the feedback, but it&rsquo;s the way to grow. It can help resolve latent tensions, correct wrong impressions, and get better results in the future.</p>

 <h2><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL DISTRIBUTION</span>s Are Transparent</h2>
  <p>We don&rsquo;t think that <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL DISTRIBUTION</span>s will work without complete transparency. The temptation will be there to block the identity of the allocator or the recipient, or to block the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s allocated. Don&rsquo;t yield to it, it is fear speaking. We don&rsquo;t think that anything less than full disclosure will work.</p>
  <p>Of course, you&rsquo;ll have to figure out what works for you, but hiding any of this information is likely to turn out to be a failure.</p>
 
 <h2><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s Account for the Unaccountable</h2>
  <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s represent many things other than simple financial value. They are not beans, but they can be counted.</p>
  <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s you have represent how other people feel about you and how they value your contributions. If you are making us miserable, you&rsquo;ll probably get fewer <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s from us; if you are helping us thrive, you&rsquo;ll likely get more. If you do something that goes against our Impact, &ldquo;but, hey, it makes money,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll get less <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s; if instead you introduce a way to make money <em>and</em> strengthen our alignment, you&rsquo;ll get more <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>
  <p>Maybe I gave you <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s because you noticed that I was down and you talked to me and helped me get over a personal crisis. Or they may reflect the fact that you always make yourself available to help others in the team. Or it may indicate that you are a very effective coach, gentle and inspirational at the same time.</p>
  <p>In short, <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s account for the uncountable. They measure what had previously been immeasurable.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Wealth Extraction</h1>
 <p>You can calculate the amount each co-owners have earned by factoring the total revenue through the allocated <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. For example,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Six of us generate $16,000 in dividends.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">There is a total of 1,000 RADs allocated which means that each <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> is worth $16 this cycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">You have 450 allocated RADs and I have 130.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">You <em>earned</em> $7,200 and I&rsquo;ve <em>earned</em> $2,080 of the total dividends.</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>That earned amount is split between Dividends and a <em>Predictable Recurring Income</em> (PRI) component.</p>

 <h2>Making Recurring Takehome Pay Predictable</h2>
   <p>When you really think about it, &ldquo;salary&rdquo; is a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> tool. Employees get a more or less predictable wage in exchange for doing as the boss says. Salaries, such as they are today, do not quite fit in the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> context.</p>
   <p>The <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> is what every co-owner takes home every period (<em>e.g.</em>, biweekly, monthly),</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Each member determines their <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span>. This is what they feel they need to take home every month.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Along with expenses, loan repayment, and other fixed expenses, the sum of everybody&rsquo;s <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> determines what for simplicity we&rsquo;ll call the company&rsquo;s breakeven point.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Every month, the company pays its bills and all <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span>s and what&rsquo;s left is distributed as Earned Dividends according to each person&rsquo;s <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>  allocations. This is the happy path.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">As a company, we can get a loan or  an investment for the <em><span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> Fund</em>. When revenue doesn&rsquo;t cover the breakeven point, money flows out of the <em><span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> Account</em> to cover a member&rsquo;s full <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span>. This makes it possible for each co-owners to take home a predictable amount.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Each co-owner is responsible for her <em><span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> Account</em> and has to pay back what they got out of it. Most likely, this will be paid back out of Earned Dividends once revenue goes above breakeven, but this is something you&rsquo;d have to experiment with.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">In the worst case, if the company goes belly up,
      <ul>
       <li>If <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> was funded with investment money, there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;debt&rdquo; to be paid back.</li>
       <li>If it was funded with a loan, then people with unpaid balances have to make good on it.</li>
      </ul>
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>The <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> functions a lot like a salary,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">If I earned <em>more</em> than my <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span>, then I can take home my <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> <em>and my Earned Dividends</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">If what I&rsquo;ve earned matches my <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span>, then I take that much home.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">If I earned <em>less than my <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span></em>, I still take home <em>the amount of money I expected</em>, because the <em><span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> Account</em> makes up the difference, but I now owe the difference to the <em><span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> Account</em>.</p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>You&rsquo;ll have to experiment with how these debts are settled. At its loosest, I could pay that debt &ldquo;later&rdquo; (<em>e.g.</em>, out of my future Earned Dividends). At its most rigid, I&rsquo;d have to pay the <em><span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> Account</em> debt, plus interest, within, say, 60 days. Our suggestion, as always, is to go for a policy that matches peoples' needs and situation. If a problem crops up, then tweak the policy as appropiate. In any case, don&rsquo;t yield to imagined fears.</p>
   <p>In the example below, Salim, Daliah, Alicia, and Anita earned enough dividends to cover their full <em>Predictable  Recurring Income</em> (<span class="_paradigm">PRI</span>); Kim and Julio earned less than their <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span>, so money flows out of the <em><span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> Account</em> to make up the difference, but they now owe this much to the <em><span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> Account</em>.</p>

   </p>
   <p>We had a lot of back and forth over the <em><span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> Account</em> being a <em>personal</em> debt. Why not have it be a shared debt? This may work for small groups, but it doesn&rsquo;t scale well. In a large group, it would make co-owners responsible for debt accumulated by people they don&rsquo;t know that well. They would want to know things like &ldquo;Why is Julio&rsquo;s <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> so high?&rdquo; On the other hand, as a personal debt, everybody can figure out what works for them and decide accordingly. Maybe Julio doesn&rsquo;t feel good about going into so much debt and brings down his <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> after realizing that he had jacked it up out of unexamined fears. Or maybe he is helping pay for his sister&rsquo;s school and is willing to bear the debt for a while longer.</p>
   <p>If you are thinking that this process takes a lot of time, you&rsquo;re right. But it is cheaper and healthier than leaving tension to fester. That anger and bottled up frustration translates to less engaged people and less trust within the team. This is very expensive and very unhealthy in the long-term (and even in the short-term).</p>

 <h2>Dividends Are Not a Gift, You Earned Them</h2>
  <p>Below there are three sample scenarios for how Earned Dividends are calculated,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Below breakeven: When we as a company don&rsquo;t generate enough Dividends to cover everybody&rsquo;s <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span>s in full and the difference has to come out of the <em><span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> Account</em>s.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">At breakeven: When we make enough to at least pay everybody&rsquo;s <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p style="margin-bottom:6px; margin-left;0;">Above breakeven: When we as a company can pay everybody&rsquo;s <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> <em>and</em> disburse Earned Dividends.</p>
    </li>
   </ul>
  <p>This first scenario is what normally happens at the start of a company: it doesn&rsquo;t generate enough revenue to cover everybody&rsquo;s <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span>. In this case, we would need a cash infusion to the <em><span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> Account</em> so we can use it to meet the amount of <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span> each person has set.</p>

  <p>At some point, after we&rsquo;ve been steadily growing our revenue, no money is coming out of our <em>Predictable  Recurring Income</em> (PRI). This is when we start disbursing Earned Dividends in addition to covering everybody&rsquo;s <span class="_paradigm">PRI</span>.</p>

 <h2>Comparing the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Investment Model with that of Banks and VCs</h2>
   <p><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investments will, at worst, have the same financial yield as today&rsquo;s VC system, but with 1) a lot more beneficiaries (<em>i.e.</em>, all the co-owners), and 2) less risk (<em>i.e.</em>, because a lot more people will be committed to making it work).</p>

RADICAL defines a large vertical parallelogram, with its dot at a little less than half way into the RISKS axis and nine tenth of the way up
