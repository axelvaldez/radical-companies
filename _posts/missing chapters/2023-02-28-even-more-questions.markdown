<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Every time I talk about <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> and the co-ownership model a question always comes up that surprises me.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <div>The questions were about hiring. I tried to explain that my preference is that they'd be no hiring, per se. The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> system is set up for that. But to no avail,</div>
  <div class="_speakera">What do you do if you can&rsquo;t offer as much as the comptetion?</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">You don&rsquo;t have competition. You must be doing something different or else you should create an ensemble with &ldquo;the competition&rdquo;, or join them if you are working towards the the exact same impact.</div>
  <div class="_quotespan">You'll make money based on your contributions, that won&rsquo;t change. And you'll work faster.</div>
  <div><span class="_quotespanc">Absolute win</span>, which is what you are describing, is what we know and it is <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> thinking, for a world driven by capital: I win it all, you lose all. However, it is not the fastest way to have a broad impact in a world based on contributions.</div>
  <div class="_speakera">I don&rsquo;t understand. What if they steal my ideas?</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">OK. OK. You cannot steal other people&rsquo;s ideas and they cannot [exagerated air quotes] &ldquo;steal&rdquo; yours. Somebody else can copy what they understood of your ideas</span>, but that is it. Besided in a transparent world you can always copy ideas.</div>
  <div class="_quotespanc">Back to the &ldquo;offer more money&rdquo; competition&hellip; let&rsquo;s say that this four people around you are completely <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>. All they know is that money works and they offere your candidate more than you. Time and time again, they &ldquo;win.&rdquo; It seems to me that those people that went for &ldquo;more money&rdquo; would not be aligned with you community. Keep looking until one the candidates show enouhg interest and curiosity. That is the candidate you want. One that you don&rsquo;t have to convince, one who wants to learn.</div>
  <div class="_speakera">But what if she doesn't have the skills I need.</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">To make sure&hellip; this is person who knows how to program, but she doen&rsquo;t know the language your team needs, is that it?</div>
  <div class="_speakera">Exactly!</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">And you don&rsquo;t think that she can learn a new language?</div>
  <div class="_speakera">Right! Well, no&hellip; Yes, she can learn. But I need to know it the minute she walks in the door.</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">Bad planning on your part, then, right?&hellip; By the way, do you know how to program?</div>
  <div class="_speakera">Yes&hellip;</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">So you were you born knowing all the programming languages, ever, rights?</div>
  <div class="_speakera">Of course not, but&hellip;</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">&hellip; then, why not give her a chance to learn the new language, which looks a lot like other languages? She doesn't have to spend time learning the co-managemnt and co-ownership side, so she spends time learning what she needs to learn? She is already aligned with the learning culture you want to build. Also, make sure to explain that your team needs for her this language fast, and maybe she konws somebody who does and can mentor her or she can propose another one that would be better suited.</div>
