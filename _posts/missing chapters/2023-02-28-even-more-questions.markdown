<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Every time I talk about <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> and the co-ownership model a question always comes up that surprises me.</p>
</div>

<h1>Language Skills and Culture</h1>
 <div>The questions were about hiring. I tried to explain that my preference is that they'd be no hiring, per se. The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> system is set up for that. But to no avail,</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">what do you do if you can&rsquo;t offer as much as the comptetion?</div>
  <div class="_quotespan">You don&rsquo;t have competition. You must be doing something different or else you should create an ensemble with &ldquo;the competition&rdquo;, or join them if want to make the same impact.</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">I don&rsquo;t understand.</div>
  <div class="_quotespan">OK. OK. Let&rsquo;s say that this four people around you are completely <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>. All they know is that money works and offers your candidate more than you. Time and time again, they &ldquo;win.&rdquo; Those people that went for &ldquo;more money&rdquo; you would not be aligned with you. Keep looking until one the candidates show enouhg interest and curiosity. That is the candidate you want. One that you don&rsquo;t have to convince, one who wants to learn.</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">But what if she doesn't have the skils I need.</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">Assuming that this is a program that knows how to program, but she doen&rsquo;t know the language you need, is that it?</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">Exactly!</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">And you don&rsquo;t think that she can learn a new language?</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">Right!</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">Do you know how to program?</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">Yes&hellip;</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">Were you born knowing all the prograamming languages including future one?</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">Of course not, but&hellip;</div>
  <div class="_spearkerb">&hellip; then, why not give a chance to learn the new language, which looks a lot like other languages? She doesn't have to spend time learning the co-managemnt and co-ownership side, so she spend time learning what she needs to learn? She is already aligned with the culture you want to build, a learning culture. So&hellip; </div>
