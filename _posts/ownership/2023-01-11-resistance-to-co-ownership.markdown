<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Resistance to co-ownership will come from everywhere. A safe bet is that the sole owners will say that it is a communist plot. But it will come from non-onwers, too.</p>

 <p>Resistance to co-ownership will come from everywhere. A safe bet is that some owners, maybe many, will say it is a communist plot.</p>

 <p>People who,</p>

      <p style="padding-left:30px; ">Just got to be owners, or</p>

      <p style="padding-left:10px; ">Just made it into the lower middle class, or</p>

      <p>Are on the verge of leaving poverty behind them</p>

  <p>These folks are more likely to reject, possibly strongly, anything that sounds like a change to the system that they have learned used to &ldquo;win.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>And Co-Onwership Is a Big Change</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership makes it possible for everybody to be a co-owner. Everybody, not just the selected few who learned how to use the system to <em>win</em>. Simple as that.</p>
 <p>But resistance to change is understandable and <em>to be expected</em>.</p>
