<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Resistance to co-ownership will come from everywhere. A safe bet is that the sole owners will say that it is a communist plot. But it will come from non-onwers, too.</p>

 <p>Resistance to co-ownership will come from everywhere. A safe bet is that some owners, maybe many, will say it is a communist plot.</p>

<h1>Poor-to-Better Off Non-Owners</h1>
 <p>People who are on the verge of leaving poverty behind them and people who just made it into the lower middle class are more likely to reject anything that sounds like system change.</p>

<h1>Better Off Non-Owners-to-Owner</h1>
 <p>People who are on the verge of becoming better off and people who just made it into that class are more likely to reject anything that sounds like system change.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> <em>IS</em> Change</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> paradigm changes non-owners to co-<em>owners</em>. Simple as that. But resistance to change is understandable and to be expected.</p>
