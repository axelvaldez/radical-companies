 <p><span class="_quotespan">Just get rid of ownership and everything will be fine</span>. This is a recurring and dangerous fantasy. Although we have taken it to an extreme, ownership is actually a good thing.</p>

 <p>Just get rid of ownership and everything will be fine.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Different version of this belief seem to be eternal, <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; the simpler life,</span> <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; home grown food,</span> <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; the values of the indiginous people.</span> However, the various attempt at this ideal have not changed anything. We need a path to a sustainable future for our anthropocene. We need to break lose from our current system of extraction and exploitation.</p>
 <p>Ownership, although we have taken it to an extreme in our <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> world, is actually one of the tools that will move us forward. Not to exclude people. We simply need to decentralize it and make it available, really available, to everyone on the planet.</p>

<h1>Corporate Ownership is Bad</h1>
 <p>In our <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> world, what we call <em>corporate ownership</em> has been weaponized. For example, music is exploited for financial gain by squeezing every possible penny out of it; even your ideas belong to the company you happen to work for.</p>
 <p>To top it off, corporate ownership is fixed, forever.</p>

<h1>Personal Ownership is Good</h1>
 <p>On the other hand, personal ownership<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> is a good thing: this is my house, not yours; this is your toothbrush, not mine.</p>
 <p>We (mostly) don’t have to fight over it.</p>

<h1>Fixed Ownership is Bad</h1>
 <p>The worst part of corporate ownership is that it is forever fixed, never changig. If you get 30% of a company, that 30% is yours forever. Your relatives can inherit it, for generations, just like Prince Charles became King of Britain after mommy Queen died, who became Queen after her dad died, who&hellip; you get the point.</p>

<h1>Dynamic Ownership Is Good</h1>
 <p>The alternative to fixed ownership, based on force, is dynamic ownership, based on contributions.</p>
 <p>Our <em>RADs!</em> application makes it possible to quantify contributions.</p>

<h1>RADs!</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Everybody gets the <em>RADs!</em> app.</li>
  <li>We all use the app to recognize contributions as we see them.</li>
  <li>Based on these <em>contributions</em>, the <em>RADs!</em> app calculates <em>how many</em> <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s each person gets.
  <div class="_center">

    width="70%"
    alt="">
  </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>The number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s a person has determines the amount of ownership she has.</li>
  <li>The number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s one has determines the amount of tangibles (<em>i.e.</em>, dividends, assets, brand, etc.) each person gets.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Also,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are a dimensionless unit of measure (<em>e.g.</em>, not a currency).</li>
   <li>The recognition criteria is completely up to each person. This is what makes a decentralized distribution possible.</li>
   <li>Every person gets the same number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s (<em>i.e.</em>, one per day).</li>
   <li>Recognitions are translated to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</li>
   <li><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are translated to tangibles.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>And, also,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s represent dynamic ownership. One month I may get a lot of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, but next month I may not get any.</li>
   <li>My percentage ownership goes up and down dynamically. For example,</li>
   <div class="_center" style="margin-top:1em; ">
    <img
     src="/assets/img/rads-fluctuations.svg"
     width="50%"
     alt="">
   </div>
   <li>If you have 200 <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s and I have 100, then you’ll get twice (the revenue, assets, etc.) as me.</li>
  </ul>
