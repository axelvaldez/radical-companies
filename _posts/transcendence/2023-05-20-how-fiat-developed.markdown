<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>This should be called <em>How <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> developed, according to me.</em> I don&rsquo;t even claim that this true, just that it plausible.</p>

<h1>The Ys</h1>
 <p>I will use <em>the Ys</em> to refer to the character of Jesus (Yassoo) in the Christian Bible. We really don&rsquo;t know if there was such a person, or a number of people, or if was the prevailing feeling at the time that was being featured..</p>

<h1>Disentangling</h1>
 <p>This is what was happening in the land of the Ys,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>A few Hebrews were exploiting the mass of Hebrews. They appropriated the wealth the unwashed masses generated.</li>
  <li>Romans soldiers provided the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> muscle: <span class="_paradigm">Threat</span> to survival, <span class="_paradigm">Fear</span>, <span class="_paradigm">Force</span>, and <span class="_paradigm">Pain</span>,</li>
  <li>Hebrew collaborators (<em>e.g.</em>, the merchants) took advantage of the structure.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The collaborator Hebrews complained and eventually the Romans put down the Ys. However, the story of an individual crucifiction is more dramatic and has carried to this day.</p>

<h1>Long Time Coming</h1>
 <p>Assuming that the stories in the Hebrew Bible was more or less copied from similar stories in the area, resistance to being exploited had been raging for a long time.</p>

   <p>In our ancestral state, humans were probably organized in small troups of related individuals. We shared resources within this group, and battled other groups for food and territory. Gradually troups gave way to organizing in tribes. After many millennia, these tribes began to merge into larger chiefdoms. Chiefdoms eventually merged into states. And states merged into empires. At every stage, competition raged between groups and was suppressed within groups.</p>

 <p>By the time Thomas Hobbes writes <em>Leviathan</em> the idea that people were a warring species was already completely normalized. Hobbe argued that humanity&rsquo;s natural state was a &ldquo;&rdquo;war of all against all.&ldquo;</p>
