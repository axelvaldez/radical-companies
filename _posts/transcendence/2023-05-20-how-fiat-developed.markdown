 <p>How <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> developed: from strong families that helped their communities, through the industrial revolution, through today.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>It should be called <em>How <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> developed, according to me.</em> I don&rsquo;t even claim that this true, just that it plausible.</p>

<h1>The Ys</h1>
 <p>I will use <em>the Ys</em> to refer to the character of Jeus (Yassoo) in the Christian Bible. We really don&rsquo;t know if there was such a person, or a number of people, or if was the prevailing feeling at the time that it was Jews exploiting Jews, using Romans as muscle. Because that is what the story of the Ys is all about.</p>

<h1>Disentangling</h1>
 <p>This is what was happening in the land of the Ys,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Hebrews were exploiting other Hebrews by appropriating the wealth they generated.
  <li>Romans soldiers provided the muscle: <span class="_paradigm">THREAT</span>, <span class="_paradigm">FEAR</span>, <span class="_paradigm">FORCE</span>, and <span class="_paradigm">PAIN</span></li>
  <li>Hebrew collaborators (<em>e.g.</em>, the merchants) took advantage of the structure. In exchange, they kept the peace.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Assuming that the stories in the Hebres Bible was copy-pasted from similar stories in the area, resistance to being exploited had been raging around longer.</p>
  <div class="_central">
   <p>In our ancestral state, humans were probably organized in small troups of related individuals. We shared resources within this group, and battled other groups for food and territory. Gradually troups gave way to organizing in tribes. After many millennia, these tribes began to merge into larger chiefdoms. Chiefdoms eventually merged into states. And states merged into empires. At every stage, competition raged between groups and was suppressed within groups.</p>
   &hellip;
   <p>Whenever we find institutional hierarchy, I predict we’ll find the power ethos. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if we’re studying a feudal fiefdom, an archaic kingdom, a totalitarian regime, a democratic state, or a modern corporation. If there is hierarchy, &hellip access to resources will grow with hierarchical power.</p>

 <p>By the time Thomas Hobbes write <em>Leviathan</em> the idea what were a warring species was already completely normalized. Hobbe argued that humanity&rsquo;s natural state was a &ldquo;&rdquo;war of all against all.&ldquo;</p>

 <p>Humans are social animals who compete as groups, but suppress internal competition for stability. <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> Hierarcy is used to stablize a group.</p>
