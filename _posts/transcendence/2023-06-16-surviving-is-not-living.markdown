<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>First, I jumped into the void, and I jumped past my fears. Then came a positive view of live; I discovered the light in my life.</p>
 <p>I am not split between my &ldquo;personal&rdquo; live and my &ldquo;work&rdquo; life. I am one and the same no matter what I am doing. Love for myself exploded into my life and I now recognize the fears that &ldquo;work&rdquo; brings up.</p>
 <p>I was surviving, not living. But now I can recognize the fears that hold me back, in survival mode. I can go around them, lovinglly, and go on with my life, guided my me, not my fears.</p>
 <p>I am still afraid of living, but I am living my life. The more I do it, the easier it gets.</p>
 <p>I am  not afraid of death, and I think that is what makes living easier. I am not afraid of dying, so I am not afraid of living.</p>
 <p>Nobody knows how to live my life better than myself. Nobody, besides me, knows what&rsquo;s best for me.</p>
 <p>Security and control are now foreign to me. I know they were they priority at one point, but no more.</p>
