<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>MoTown Records<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> came to be because African American artists needed something fundamentally different than what the existing record labels offered.  MoTown promoted their music, their concept of music, their categories, and even their approach to it, more sensual and religious at the same time.  The existing labels were not capable of providing any of that, even with the best of intentions.</p>
 <p>As MoTown was to Black artists and their music, <span class="_paradigm">rMEDIA</span> is to <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> authors and themes.</p>

<h1>Origin Story</h1>
 <p>The way it works now, publishers license your content and take on all the risk in exchange for selling your content under their ISBN.  You own the content, they own <em>only</em> the ISBN. The publisher also owns the brand which they have built over many years and this imprimatur shines a light on your content. At least, that’s the historical narrative, but today it has evolved into something different.</p>
 <p>Long story short, most authors make very little or no money from the sales of the book.  According to author Chuck Blakeman, “commissions are absurdly low, 8-11% generally. They can be delayed up to 30 months, after printing, distribution, and 12 months in bookstores.  Essentially, you become the bank for the publishers.” The publisher may or may not invest in any promotion.  In many cases, the publisher uses the content as a trial balloon, to see if it has traction.  If it does, they invest in promoting it, make a lot of money, and you may get some minor fame out of it and some speaking and consulting gigs.  If your content doesn’t show traction, then… that’s that.</p>
 <p>No matter, your book’s ISBN still belongs to them.  You “own” the content, but the publisher is the only one who can sell it.   According to Blakeman, “they own the ability to distribute [your content] for at least five years and you have no say in the use of it.”</p>
 <p>As publisher Joshua Volpara says it, “The important thing, to me, is not that publishers own the ISBN but that authors have granted [them] the right to economic exploitation over the work without limits of time, markets and even formats (<em>e.g.</em>, ebooks) or by-products (<em>e.g.</em>, movie screen-plays). Many times these limits are too loose and the deal becomes unfair.”</p>
 <p>And, worse, the book’s message doesn’t spread widely.</p>

       &hellip; formerly the local stores in a small town competed sharply with one another. Now, … they are beginning to join in an effort to secure the trade of the outlying farming districts and of the summer residents who tend to buy from the city by mail order. They do this by saving capital through common store-houses, through dividing specialties and thus increasing stock without increasing expenditure, by improving local service through cooperative deliveries, etc.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>

  <p>At one end, authors could use the help of <span class="_paradigm">rMEDIA</span>; at the other they could do it themselves using the <span class="_paradigm">rMEDIA</span> infrastructure. My guess is that they would choose a combination of these. For example, translations work better when the author works in tandem with the translator because the author can, in real time, clarify tricky phrasing, explain idiomatic phrases, or the why of a difficult paragraph.</p>
