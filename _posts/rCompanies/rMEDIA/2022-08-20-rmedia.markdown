<h2 style="font-size:30px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Recruiting</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>From the moment a candidate voices an interest in joining the team, think of her as already in your team.</li>
  <li>You are not looking for ways to reject this candidate. Your job is to evaluate at what stage the candidate is in, figure out if you can help her grow, and then make a decision to hire or not.</li>
  <li>Interviewers self-select.</li>
  <li>Someone self-selects to act as lead, with the team’s consent.</li>
  <li>Tech Screen,</li>
   <ul>
    <li>Talk with the candidate for 15 minutes or less to determine whether she is up to the interview process.</li>
    <li>Either way, let the candidate know right away.</li>
    <li>If the candidate passes the screen, fix dates for all interviews.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>Schedule all subsequent interviews.</li>
   <li>Profile interview,</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Check for cultural alignment (<em>i.e.</em>, according to your Impact, Purpose, and Mission or whatever Alignment principles you use).</li>
     <li>Check for level of knowledge about Computer Science basics.</li>
     <li>Decide if a Task interview is appropriate. The candidate is part of this discussion.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Task interview,</li>
     <ul>
      <li>For developers, this is done as a Pair Programming with pre-defined exercises for the appropriate stack. For manual testers, the candidate is given a scenario and asked to put together a test plan.</li>
      <li>Work and talk with the candidate.</li>
      <li>Offer hints (“I saw a thread in StackOverflow abou that”).</li>
      <li>Question/nudge as needed (“wouldn't it be easier, if you did…”).</li>
      <li>One interviewer acts as a distractor (<em>i.e.</em>$, to learn if the candidate is easily distracted or not, and whether she loses her train of thought easily or not).</li>
      <li>The Task interview includes three exercises,</li>
       <ul>
        <li>Easy. Doable within a half hour. Meant to make the candidate feel good, confident.</li>
        <li>Middling. Doable within one hour.</li>
        <li>Difficult. Doable within two hours. Instructions for the difficult exercise are incomplete to see what the candidate does about it.</li>
       </ul>
      <li>Give the candidate feedback immediately, as much as you can.</li>
     </ul>
     <li>Thumbs meeting</li>
      <ul>
       <li>Everybody who's talked to the candidate gets together.</li>
       <li>On their own, they grade the candidate on 1-4 scale on a) tech skills and b) cultural alignment.</li>
       <li>They disclose their ratings (<em>e.g.</em>, Planning Poker) and discuss results.</li>
       <li>If need be, update ratings.</li>
       <li>Repeat until the decision to hire/not hire is made.</li>
       <li>If the decision is to pass but offer Office Hours, whoever volunteers to do it takes the lead and talks to the candidate about the process, etc.</li>
       <li>If the decision is to hire, but it includes the Skills Incubator, then a member of the team takes the lead to talk with the candidate about the process, etc.</li>
       <li>If the decision is to hire, then you’re done.</li>
      </ul>
     </ul>
 <p>The interview process must be completely transparent. Interviewers must keep notes throughout the process and share them with the candidate at the end of it,</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Tell rejected candidates exactly why you decided against hiring.</li>
   <li>Include very specific recommendations for how to close any gaps you found.</li>
  </ol>
<h2 style="font-size:30px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Office Hours</h1>
 <p>Offer rejected candidates the opprtunity to join you for Office Hours. For example, you could commit to doing two sessions per week, one hour each.</p>
 <p>During these sessions,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Review the recommendations with her</li>
   <li>Figure out a plan, including books and sites to read, bloggers to follow, Pair exercises, etc.</li>
   <li>Encourage her to join StackOverflow, sign up for GitHub, join, or even start, an OSS project.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>When you think she's ready, ask her if she's ready to try again, and if so, tell your team.</p>
 <p>If they agree to take her on again, they pick up where the process stopped. If she was disqualified after the Profile interview, then start by having another Profile interview. Ditto if the process was stopped at the Task interview. Of course, the team can decide to skip, say, the Profile and go straight to the Task.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:30px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Incubator</h1>
 <p>This Incubator is for people who is missing a key skill, or doesn’t have experienced with a particular technology,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>After the Thumbs, a member of the team tells the candidate about the Skills Incubator.</li>
   <li>The team had already estimated how long it would take the candidate to complete the program, now ask the candidate for her own estimate.</li>
   <li>Share the team's estimate (<em>i.e.</em>, usually their estimate is lower than the team’s).</li>
   <li>Now you can both figure out what the appropriate estimate is to complete the Skills Incubator program.</li>
   <li>Use an in-house or external program to do the necessary training.</li>
   <li>Assign a mentor.</li>
   <li>The mentor's job is to check with the candidate about her progress, any questions she may have, any topic the mentor feels she needs help with.</li>
  </ul>
<h2 style="font-size:30px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Power Up</h1>
 <p>This program is for members who want to learn a new skill or a new stack,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>For example, an Android developer wants to learn iOS or a C++ developer realizes she needs to learn a functional language.</li>
   <li>The Power Up program leverages the experience a developer has gained to deliver the equivalent of one year experience in a few weeks. Shifting to a new paradigm will take longer (<em>e.g.</em>, from object oriented to functional).</li>
   <li>A kickoff Power Up program covers the basics, but the rest would come in follow up workshops and production work.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 style="font-size:30px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Holding on to Your Chicken</h1>
 <p>The “chicken” comes from an illustration that Kimberly Wiefling<sup id="id04"><a href="#en04">4</a></sup> uses in her workshops where she holds a rubber chicken up over her head, let go of it, and let it fall to the floor. Then she asks, “what happened to the chicken?” The responses are usually all over the place, but every so often a small voice says, “… because you let it go of it?” And that’s the point: you let go of your power, your essence, to others. And those more powerful than you grab it as soon as you let go of it.</p>
 <p>We learn this habit at home, when we are little. We let our caretakers guide our chickens as they teach us the basics of staying alive. Once we enter school, most of our teachers, unfortunately, take our chickens from us outright. “You must learn discipline,” they tell us, “and I’ll tell you how to behave.” Throughout school we learn that obedience comes first: if we don’t please the teacher, we don’t get the sticker, or, worse, we are sent to the Principal’s office. Finally, we reach college, but by then the habit is deeply ingrained. Undergraduates are like high-schoolers with a bit more freedom outside of school, but in school it is a game of pleasing the professor and getting good grades. Grad students are often referred to as “slave labor” for their supervisors. By the time we start to work, we are fully conditioned to hand our chickens to our superiors, “Where do I sit? What team am I in? What do you want me to do, boss?”We have to grow out of the habit of letting go of our chicken. We need to learn to hold on to it. In fact, we can make companies better all around by holding on to our chicken. We can collaborate more openly, experiment more, innovate more, come up with outside-the-box solutions more often. We can bring our full selves to work, take off our masks, and stop holding back. We can bring real value as we create with others.</p>
 <p>Ideally, we would not learn the habit of giving up our chicken so easily in the first place, but at our workplaces we can certainly replace that terrible habit with the habit of holding on to our chicken.</p>
