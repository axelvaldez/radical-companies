<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>The PRADERA SHELF could bring new life to small booksellers and make their business more profitable.</p>

<h1>Features<h1>
 <p>Retailers would have an area, called the SHELF, dedicated to PRADERA MEDIA content.</p>
 <p>Later, retailers could include other publishers, but they would have to pay a fee to the store for the privilege (at that point the store would probably have to buy the SHELF).</p>
 <p>Mobile phones and pads will readily connect to the SHELF to,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Download/listen/watch content.</li>
   <li>Upload reviews and other content, such as text, audio, or video (see PRADERA MAKE).</li>
   <li>Download the first few chapters of a book for free or the whole book at a discount.</li>
   <li>Get a discount coupon to buy a paper copy of the book at the hosting store.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>See PRADERA READER.</p>
 <p>The SHELF is designed to be noticeable. A couple of elevated chairs could serve as a SHELF or maybe a single booth. This would be a space for quiet reading and also for readers to meet and talk (i.e., instant book clubs).</p>
 <p>Whatâ€™s disruptive about this is that,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The SHELF is different and becomes a conversation piece (i.e., love or hate it, it gets mentioned online).</li>
   <li>The store gets increased foot traffic.</li>
   <li>More book copies are sold.</li>
   <li>PRADERA MEDIA gets all contact info (opt-in) collected at the SHELF.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Footprints could span from a single-user booth, to a platform with several chairs in it, or even a counter where people could sit and read.</p>
