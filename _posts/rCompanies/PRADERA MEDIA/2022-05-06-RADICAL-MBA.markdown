<h1>Origin Story</h1>
 <p>The idea came up during a conversation with Jose Leal and Marcial Quintanar. One thing led to another and we ended up with rough plans for a RADICAL MBA.</p>

<h1>Facilitated Workshops</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>A formal, facilitated, co-training program that combines elements from the RADICAL PURPOSE and RADICAL COMPANIES models.</li>
  <li>RADICAL PURPOSE outlines an alternative model to FIAT thinking.</li>
  <li>RADICAL COMPANIES outlines a model for creating a co-managed and co-owned company shaped by the RADICAL PURPOSE mindset.</li>
  <li>The workshop includes exercises and Q&A.</li>
 </ul>

     <li>Marcial will try it out in Mexico, as part of a group of businessmen he’s part of. He already meets with small groups, and will start mastermind-like meetings with people who are interested in an alternative to FIAT management and ownership.</li>
     <li>Eventually, it may be offered as a “diplomado” (<em>i.e.</em>, certificate).</li>
     <li>Could even become an IPADE and Stanford alternative MBA.</li>

<h1>What's in It for …?</h1>
 <table> 
  <tr>
   <td style="font-weight:bold; ">People</td>
   <td>For business people, it would be a safe space to develop their mindset beyond FIAT. It should feel like a weight lifted off their shoulders (<em>i.e.</em>, letting go of all that fear).</td>
   <td>For facilitators, it would strengthen their RADICAL muscles. It would also potentially provide future business to help the business folks actually go through real metamorphosis (<em>i.e.</em>, co-ownership opportunities).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="font-weight:bold; ">Companies</td>
  </tr>
   <td>As they break free of their FIAT ways they will experience  lower costs (e.g., less turnover, higher productivity), innovation (e.g., operations, new products and services), higher Earned Dividends.</td>

   <td style="font-weight:bold; ">Communities</td>
