<h1>How It Works</h1>
 <h2>Embrace FIAT</h2>
  <p>The FIAT world is our own creation and we start by embracing that.  When we engage with folks creating or running a business, even startups, we are engaging with FIAT minded people. In fact, most people around today are FIAT minded. That’s not a “fault” of theirs, that’s just the way it is.</p>
  <p>When we engage with established companies that want to make the transition,<sup id="enref01"><a href="#en01">1</a></sup> they are going to show up as FIAT companies.  Their top boss has an intuition about “a better way,” but she’ll hear everything you say through FIAT filters.</p>
  <p>Don’t roll your eyes.  Don’t get exasperated.  Don’t smirk.  “Help people reach their full potential.  Catch them doing something right.”<sup id="enref02"><a href="#en02">2</a></sup> People have spent years learning FIAT habits.  You have to help them walk away from those and get used to RADICAL habits.  Show them compassion, not pity, and respect for their commitment to the transformation.</p>
  <p>You are not going to win them all.  You just have to figure out when you can walk away and leave them to build their co-management and co-ownership skills without you.</p>

 <h2>Rinse and Repeat</h2>
  <p>This is about the various ways to get the basics out and repeat them over and over to let them sink in.  We learn by repetition, so repeat.</p>
  <p>TBD.</p>

 <h2>Workshops</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Describe scenario</li>
   <li>Team plays out a response</li>
   <li>Retrospective to identify FIAT behavior (<em>e.g.</em>, competitive)</li>
   <li>Brainstorming for RADICAL alternatives (<em>e.g.</em>, collaboration)
  <ol>

 <h2>Triads</h2>
  <p>David Logan, researcher and principal author of Tribal Leadership, suggested forming triads, a group of three people, to support each other.  So instead of the “1-on-1 with your boss,” you could instead do it with your peers. Logan meant triads as a mechanism to help people move up the <em>five tribal stages</em>,</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Life sucks</li>
    <li>My life sucks</li>
    <li>I’m great (and you’re not)</li>
    <li>We are great (and they’re not)</li>
    <li>Life is great</li>
   </ol>
  <p>Ideally, the triad would include somebody who’s a “stage four” person.  As Logan would have it, “You’ll know these individuals by (1) their focus on “we,” (2) the number of triads in their networks, and (3) success that comes from groups.”<sup id="enref03"><a href="#en03" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
  <p>Triads are a co-training tool, where everybody ends up a RADICAL evangelist. Hatchers would be the first “stage four” cohort to kick off the triads, but then they would replace themselves with <em>RADICAL-IN-TRAINING</em> folks.</p>

 <h2>RADICAL Farm Systems</h2>
  <p>This technique is inspired by Cesar Millan, The Dog Whisperer, and his dog “farm.”.  His large backyard is full of dogs that simply behave like dogs.  Other dogs can stay in the farm for a while to learn to be dogs. Most of the time, a “trouble dog” is trouble only because of its owner.  These are not mean people, but they treat their dogs as babies, siblings, or roommates.  But dogs are dogs, not humans. Atd his farm, Cesar let the dogs get back to their roots.  When they “graduate” from the farm, these are, literally, RADICAL dogs.</p>
  <p>RADICAL<em> </em>Farms would serve a similar purpose.  People from would-be RADICAL companies would spend time at one of the many RADICAL farms in the system.  These “farms” are RADICAL companies that are prepared to host would-be RADICAL so they can learn how to let go of fear driven habits.</p>
  <p>If dogs can learn how to be dogs from other dogs, people can best learn how to be people from other people.</p>

 <h2>Emerging Sensitivities</h2>
  <p>We are very sensitive about people who want to dominate us.  When people say, “I’ve always had trouble with authority,” I hear that as “I am very sensitive to anything and anybody trying to dominate me, and I always resist.”  That’s because we have grown up in a system fueled by domination.</p>
  <p>We need to help people to let go of this and other fear-based habits and learn collaborative habits.</p>

 <h2>Co-Ownership Workshops</h2>
  <p>Help people figure out how to get started experimenting with this thing.</p>

<h1>rHatchery</h1>
 <h2>Who Belongs</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>First and foremost, the rHatchery is a community.</li>
   <li>Anybody who voices “interest” is already part of it.</li>
   <li>Signed clients start in the rHatchery and remain there once they become <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OSMzaxsBEGVL4OVH_r1Q_PTrkJV7AeDA9nlNw00igkA/edit#heading=h.cs43sopv1paq">clients</a>.</li>
  </ul>

 <h2>Model</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Clients  sign an agreement (conscious contract?).</li>
   <li>There will be a rate pre-agreement and another post-agreement.</li>
   <li>And there will be a “co-ownership rate,” which means that Hatchers become co-owners of the company.</li>
  </ul>

 <h2>Process</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Talk to everyone in the company for at least one hour.</li>
   <li>Let them get out their standard war stories.</li>
   <li>Get them to talk about their ideal company.</li>
   <li>Craft a progression of stories 1) sprinkled with their individual stories, 2) that speak to their ideals, and 3) culminates with their aspirations.</li>
  </ul>
  IMAGE
  <ul>
   <li>Talk to them in small groups to 1) get the reactions to the story, and 2) start habituating them to work, and be vulnerable, in groups.</li>
  </ul>

 <h2>Learning Opportunities</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>We could invite people to give talks.</li>
   <li>We could have people present their books.</li>
   <li>Corporate Rebels can launch their University there.</li>
   <li>Allan Rhodes can talk about Reimagina.</li>
   <li>We can present our book, one chapter at a time.</li>
   <li>Jacqueline can talk about the chicken model.</li>
   <li>Kim can talk about Conscious Contracts.</li>
   <li>Train the bigger, more mature Hatchers, too,</li>
   <ul>
    <li>Kimberly can talk about what she does.</li>
    <li>Alicia can talk about the Wealthing Club</li>
    <li>Doug, Chuck, etc., can talk about their approach to co-management.</li>
    <li>Lisa Gill can talk about her stuff or do a series of interviews of Hatchers</li> 
   </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>Their pitch would have to adjust to incorporate the RADICAL model.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Hatcher triads? Mentored and learning to mentor.</li>
  </ul>

 <h2>Hatchlings</h2>
  <p>Birds go through several stages on their way to adulthood: nestling, fledgling, juvenile, and, finally, adulthood. Our job is to help these people move towards adulthood.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Once a business signs an Agreement with us they are RADICALS.</li>
   <li>Co-ownership is included in the Agreement.</li>
   <li>FIAT money payment is desirable, but not an obstacle to entry.</li>
   <li>???</li>
  </ul>

 <h2>COGS</h2>
  <p>The upfront costs should be treated as a cash infusion that has to be repaid.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Facilitating the rHatchery community.</li>
   <li>Facilitating client-specific rHatchery communities.</li>
  </ul>
