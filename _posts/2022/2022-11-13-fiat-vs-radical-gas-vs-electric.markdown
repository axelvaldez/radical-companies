<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>We can&rsquo;t get to the future in a gas-powered car; it will take us over the edge first. We need something fundamentally different from <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> to get us there.</p>

<h1>The Fiat World</h1>
 <p>The world is ruled by fiat (<em>i.e.</em>, <span class="_quotespan">because I say so</span>). The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> world we live in has worked in the sense that it has made things better for the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; countries, but it can never be just.</p>
 <p>Trying to <em>fix</em> the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> model is like trying to get a gas car to consume less. You can make the car more efficient, or even make it a gas-electric hybrid, but it will <em>always</em> be a gasoline fueled car. No gas, no work.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model is more like the all-electric car. Same look as a car, but it is fundamentally different. No gas, no problem.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> path will take us over the edge. A <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> system will take us to a more sustainable future.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>Based on Extraction</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> world is based on extraction,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>My wellbeing is extracted from everybody else&rsquo;s wellbeing (servitude).</li>
  <li>My wellbeing is determined by my (financial) wealth and my wealth is extracted from everybody else&rsquo;s wealth (enclosure).</li>
  <li>My wealth is grown by everybody else&rsquo;s labor (exploitation).</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The injustice, and oftentimes horror, that this system engenders is actually pretty predictable,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>It feeds on enclosures. What used to be for the use by the community is now for the exclusive use of the brute who moved all others out by force. These days that is government&rsquo;s work.</li>
  <li>The &ldquo;force&rdquo; can be minimal and pass unnoticed, but it is force nevertheless.</li>
  <li>People are divided by what has come to be known as classes.</li>
  <li>Classes struggle against each other and sometimes it ends up in bloody revolutions.</li>
  <li>All of these sacrifices end up ushering a new set of bosses, but the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> stays in place.</li>
  <li>At one end, it results in an absolute &ldquo;leader&rdquo; who aims to stay forever.</li>
  <li>At the other end, it ends up with elected &ldquo;leaders.&rdquo;, that nevertheless by rule by fiat.</li>
  <li>In both cases, big money calls the shots and the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> hierarchy remains. We may get a new dictator or not get reelected, but <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> stays.</li>
  <li>Servitude, enclosure, and exploitation continue unabated.</li>
  <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system has the side-effect of destroying our life support system.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>This may be disagreeable, scary, or whatnot, but it is actually rational in the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> space. We need <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span>-based communities if we want to survive.</p>

<h1>Centralization</h1>
 <p>The &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo; is not the capital system and not government. The bad guy is <em>centralized ownership</em>.</p>

<h1>Radical Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>The most important thing for our long-term survival is to decentralize ownership. And not for a few lucky people, but for everyone. I am not talking about tweaking a gas car, but creating an all-electric car. We call hat co-ownership.</p>
 <p>Maybe this was not possible earlier, but it is certainly possible now. We can distribute ownership without having a boss decide what to give, to whom. Today we can have every co-owner recognize your contributions and, from that, determine your co-ownership.</p>

    I know I am being simplistic here, but it is basically right and it is memorable.
