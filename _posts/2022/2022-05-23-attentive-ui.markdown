 <p>Graphical UIs have gone from functional very basic, to graphical, to gesture, to responsive.</p>
 <p>The Attentive UI is what comes next. As the user works with the US, it auto-morphs to make the UI fit the user&rsquo;s <em>behavior</em>. This could be as simple as rearranging menus and making the most used items easier to reach in a given context. For example, with Photoshop, I may use the brush tool a lot in one case (painting), and I may not use it at all in others.</p>

      <li>The UI is responsive to each userâ€™s actual use and development teams don&rsquo;t have to worry (as much) about how to order their menus.</li>
