 <p>We need a <em>recognition unit-of-measure</em> in additions to <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s.</p>
</div>

<h1>Units of Measure</h1>
 <p>In our book, <em><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL COMPANIES</span></em><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> we came up with <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s as a unit-of-measure. It turns out that we also need a unit-of-recognition.</p>

<h1>A Unit of Distribution</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s account for what has so far been unaccountable. They quantify contributions as given by co-owners.</p>
 <p>At distribution time the percentage of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s you have factors the amount of, say, Earned Dividends (<em>i.e.</em>, money) you get.</p>
 <p>As we tried to use <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s in the early versions of the <em>RADs! app</em>, it got too clumsy and cumbersome. Co-owners would end up adding and subtracting <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, which is exactly what we didn&rsquo;t want. We wanted to capture the <em>feeling intensity</em> that an observed contribution brought up.</p>
 
<h1>A Unit-of-Recognition</h1>
 <p>To make the app easier to use, we needed a unit-of-recognition. So we changed the app!</p>
 <p>The <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s! app</em> now lets co-owners press a recognition button as many times as they feels like it. This captures the <em>emotional</em> intensity we wanted.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom:0; ">At the end of the cycle, the <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s! app</em> converts recognitions to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s,
  <ul>
   <li>The number of recognitions co-owner A gave to other co-owners is divided by the total recognitions she gave during the period.</li>
   <li>Each resulting percentage is then multiplied by the total number of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s in the cycle (<em>i.e.</em>, co-owners get one <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> per day).</li>
   <li>This results in the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s each co-owner gets from co-owner A.</li>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <div style="text-align:center; ">

   alt="The picture depicts a simple equation. As recognitions come in, the app divides the number of recognitions per perco-ownerson by the total number of recognitions I have given. This is multiplied by the number of RADs I have received during this cycle. The result is the number of RADs I am giving to each of my peers."
