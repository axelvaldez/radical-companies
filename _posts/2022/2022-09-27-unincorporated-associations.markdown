 <p><em>Unincorporated Associations</em> (UA) are legal entities in California. <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses could use these as they transform into <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies. during a transition period. For example, <em>Pump Warriors, Inc</em> could create a <em>Pump Convivium, UA</em> for the purpose of accepting payments.</p>
 <p>Donâ€™t let <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> assumptions and fears, limit your <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> journey. Hard as it will be, take off the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> lenses and learn to see the world with your <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> eyes.</p>
