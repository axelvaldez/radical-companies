<h1>Shining Lights</h1>
 <p>It all started with shining lights on sodium atoms to correct for a telescope&rsquo;s atmospheric distortions. I think it was the scope in the Atacama Telescope, in Chile. At least, that&rsquo;s how I remember it from what I read about it in the early &rsquo;20s. I have forgotten a lot of stuff in that time, but I remember how it started.</p>

<h1>It Wasn&rsquo;t Long</h1>
 <p>It wasn&rsquo;t long after that somebody got the notion to cmbine sodium with nobelium. The nobelium a is synthetic chemical element and had to be pushed up, through the atmosphere, to the sodium atoms. Someody must have thought that was funny, because the combo created Chile saltpeter (NaNO<sub>3</sub>).</p>
 <p>It wasn&rsquo;t long after that that the military enclosed the technology and modified it to manipulate compounds at higher and higher altitudes. They were aiming for Doc Smith&rsquo;s scheme of making things at a distance.</p>
 <p>It wasn&rsquo;t long after that that borders disappeared, the military lost its reason to exist, and we were reaching out to play with the stars.</p>
