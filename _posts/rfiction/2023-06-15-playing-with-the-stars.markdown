 <p>It all started with shining lights on sodium atoms to correct for a telescope&rsquo;s atmospheric distortions. I think the scope in the Atacama Telescope, Chile. At least, that&rsquo;s how I remember it from what I read about when I was 71, 25 years ago.</p>
 <p>It wasn&rsquo;t long after that somebody get the sodium to combine with nobelium. The nobelium is synthetic chemical element and had to be pushed up, through the atmosphere to the sodium atoms. Someody must have thought that was funny, because the combo created Chile saltpeter (NaNO<sub>3</sub>). The Military, however, had a different take.</p>
 <p>It wasn&rsquo;t long after that that the military enclosed the technology and used it to manipulate compounds at higher and higher altitudes.</p>
 <p>It wasn&rsquo;t long after that it all leaked out and we were reaching out to play with the stars.</p>
