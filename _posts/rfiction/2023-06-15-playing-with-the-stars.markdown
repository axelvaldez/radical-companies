 <p>It all started with shining lights on sodium atoms to correct for a telescope&rsquo;s, in Chile, atmospheric distortions. I think the scope in the Atacam Desert, Chile, was the first one. Well, at least, that&rsquo;s the one I remember. It didn&rsquo;t take long before were actually actually manipulating the sodium and getting them to combine with nobelium, which we had to push up the atmostphere, to create Chile saltpeter (NaNO<sub>3</sub>). Somebody thought that was funny.</p>
 <p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before the military enclose the technology and use to manipulate atom and compounds at higher and higher altitudes.</p>
 <p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before it all leaked out and we were reaching out to manipulate the stars.</p>
