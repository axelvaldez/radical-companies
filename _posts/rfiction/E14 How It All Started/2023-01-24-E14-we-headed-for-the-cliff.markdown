<h1>We headed for the cliff, smiling and chatting with everybody. And then we went over the cliff.</h1>
</div>

<h1>Story Telling Time</h1>
 <p class="_quotespan">We didn&rsquo;t know <em>know</em> to care. In spite of all the virtous messaging around us, the most important thing for us was &lsquo;winning the race to a better life.&rsquo; That took precendence over everything else: our life support environment, our health, happiness, other people&hellip; over everything!</p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">People died of never heard of sicknesses. We had vaccines, but enough of them shunned them to keep these pandemics ongoing. At one point, it was too late to get back to &lsquo;normal.&rsquo; We were over the cliff, without solid ground.</span> Yalitza had to pause at this point. The memories had gotten to him.</p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Most of the very wealthy hid as well they could but eventualy they were overwhelmed. You see, staying alive was the &lsquo;better life&rsquo; for the people on the outside and they were very, <em>very</em> good at pursing it. So, if they had to overwhelm the defenses that the wealthiest had put up, that is what they would do. And that is what they did.</span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Not all the wealthy acted that way, many of them opened their doors and shared all they had and hey ended up safer, with a community around them.</span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Eventually, people got tired of trying to &lsquo;get back to normal&rsquo;. That is whe small communities became the norm. Some were nomadic, but most were sedentary, settled around their crops. Many were <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> communities with bosses ranging from paternalistic to brutal. But just as many were co-managed by the community without permanent leaders. I grew up in one of those communities,&rdquo; said Yalitza, &ldquo;but later I joined a nomadic one. And, oh, the wonders I got to see.</span></p>
 <p>One the kids in Yalitza&rsquo;s audience elbowed his sister. They looked at each other briefly and then she said, <span call="_quotespan">Is this accurate? Or are you just making it all up?</span></p>
 <p>An older one, Bal, responded, <span class="_quotespan">You have to figure it out. That&rsquo;s the point.</span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">The facts are accurate. But, yes, you have to figure out if this story about them is true, or exagerated, or otherwise twisted or corrupted.<span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">You have to think. You have to figure it out.</span> Bal repeated.</p>
 <p>Yalitza smiled at the reaction to Bal&rsquo;s refrain. Then he yawned and he said, <span class="_quotespan">And now I am goin to sleep.</span></p>
 <p>Several people in the audience yelled, <span class="_quotespan">We know how it ends!</span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Good, you can continue it then</span>, Yalitza said without looking back. <span class="_quotespan">Next time I&rsquo;ll tell a story with all the details I left out today. Goog night.</span></p>

<h1>The Voice Network</h1>
 <p>Little by little, one community at a time, a voice network was taking shape, all over the world.</p>
 <p>As Yalitza would often say in his stories, <span class="_quotespan">We kept our heads, so, use them.</span></p>
 <p>We knew about short-wave radio and there was plenty of old equipment around, in trucks and elsewhere. People wanted to connect and spent the time getting the radios going. Eventually, these people, broadcasters, started to find each other.</p>
 <p>One of the things that became popular in the network was to ask how-to question. In response, people shared instructions on how to fix some things or how to build others. Younger people were more interested in how to make hair eco-color. <span class="_quotespan">I like your shade of black, now do you make it?</span> one would ask. Most responded with the specific process, but there always was a smart ass who&rsquo;d say, <span class="_quotespan">You will also have to get yourself a black shoulder to lay on!</span> People even learned how to patch transmissions from one broadcaster to another and, slowly, the connection grew the world over.</p>

<h1>Spring Blossoms</h1>
 <p>As it it turned out, a few communities were doing original research. A community in what used to be Laos recovered digital repositories and they spend months broadcasting the content of the material over the voice network. In parallel, and with help from the Laos folks, other recpositories were recovered in Iceland and Papua and then in other places.</p>
 <p>Yalitza remembered this time, clearly, <span class="_quotespan">Sure did, I was one of the people transcribing the sutff we got. It was very exciting.</span></p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> Lurkers</h1>
 <p>During that time we also figured out how to reconize <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> communities. It was simple: they took, but never gave back. Their interactions were very limited. For example, like other they would ask for something to be repeated during broadcasts, but, other than that, they never said anything, never offered anything of value. People got angry at first, but eventually we learn to live with the fact that <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> communities were lurkers.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> Communities</h1>
 <p>In spite of being the cause of pushing us over the cliff, the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system still existed. It was alive and well in more than a few enclaves with bosses giving orders to everybody else. In a way, it is understandable because that is what most people knew from pre-cliff days. If you are convinced that the <em>normal</em> thing to do is to grin and bear it, then that is what &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; feels like to you. Besides, back then very few people understood that it was the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy that had brough us to this point; mostly they could even see it as the engine messing us up.</p>
 <p>The good news is that the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> enclaves were shrinking. People, particularly younger ones, managed to get out and easily join other communities. They would hop from one to the other until they found one that felt right, more aligned to what they were looking for. With this writing on the wall, <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> enclaves had been known to threaten their neighbors. They wanted &ldquo;their&rdquo; people back. One particular enclave, The Bracia, had been growing by rolling up other <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> enclaves and it seemed close to actually attacking their neighbors.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>Community Ensembles</h1>
 <p>The bad news is that the co-managed, co-owned communities had not defense. Well, the only &ldquo;defense&rdquo; they had, kind of, was that a lot of communities had pooled their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> systems, they had become ensembles, collaborating, just like jazz.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Maybe that would be a factor in the future.</p>
