<h1>We headed for the cliff, smiling and chatting with everybody in our gasoline-powered SUV. And then we went over the cliff.</h1>

<h1>Story Telling Time</h1>
 <p class="_quotespan">We didn&rsquo;t care; we just didn&rsquo;t <em>know</em> how. In spite of all the virtous messaging around us, the most important thing for us was &lsquo;winning the race to a better life.&rsquo; That took precendence over everything else: our life support environment, our health, happiness, other people&hellip; over everything!</p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Many people died of never heard of sicknesses. We had vaccines, but enough of them shunned them to keep these pandemics ongoing. At one point, it was too late to get back to &lsquo;normal.&rsquo; We were over the cliff, without solid ground.</span> Zep had to pause at this point. The memories had gotten to him.</p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Most of the very wealthy hid as well they could but eventualy they were overwhelmed. You see, staying alive was the &lsquo;better life&rsquo; for the people on the outside and they were very, <em>very</em> good at pursing it. So, if they had to overwhelm the defenses that the wealthiest had put up, that is what they would do. And that is what they did.</span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Not all the wealthy acted that way, many of them opened their doors and shared all they had and hey ended up safer, with a community around them.</span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Eventually, people got tired of trying to &lsquo;get back to normal&rsquo;. That is whe small communities became the norm. Some were nomadic, but most were sedentary, settled around their crops. Many were <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> communities with bosses ranging from paternalistic to brutal. But just as many were co-managed by the community without permanent leaders. I grew up in one of those communities,&rdquo; said Zep, &ldquo;but later I joined a nomadic one. And, oh, the wonders I got to see.</span></p>
 <p>One the kids in Zep&rsquo;s audience elbowed his sister. They looked at each other briefly and then she said, <span call="_quotespan">Is this accurate? Or are you just making it all up?</span></p>
 <p>An older one, Bal, responded, <span class="_quotespan">You have to figure it out. That&rsquo;s the point.</span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">The facts are accurate. But, yes, you have to figure out if this story about them is true, or exagerated, or otherwise twisted or corrupted.<span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">You have to think. You have to figure it out.</span> Bal repeated.</p>
 <p>Zep smiled at the reaction to Bal&rsquo;s refrain. Then he yawned and he said, <span class="_quotespan">And now I am goin to sleep.</span></p>
 <p>Several people in the audience yelled, <span class="_quotespan">We know how it ends!</span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Good, you can continue it then</span>, Zep said without looking back. <span class="_quotespan">Next time I&rsquo;ll tell a story with the details I left out.</span></p>

<h1>The Voice Network</h1>
 <p>Little by little, one community at a time, a voice network was taking shape.</p>
 <p>As Zep in his stories, <span class="_quotespan">We have our heads, so, use them.</span></p>
 <p>We knew about short-wave radio and there was plenty of old equipment around in trucks and elsewhere. People wanted to connect that spent the time to get the radios going and, eventually, broadcasters started to find each other.</p>
 <p>One of the things that became popular in the network was to ask how-to question. In response, people shared instructions on how to fix some things, and how to build others. Then people learned to patch transmission from one broadcaster to another and this gave place to connection the world over.</p>

<h1>Original Research</h1>
 <p>As it it turned out, a few communities were doing original research. A community in what used to be Laos recovered digital repositories and they spend months broadcasting the content of the material over the voice network. In parallel, and with help from the Laos folks, other recpositories were recovered in the islands of Iceland and Papua and then in other place.</p>
 <p>Zep remembered this time, clearly, <span class="_quotespan">Sure did, I was one of the people transcribing the dictations. It was very exciting.</span></p>
 <p>During that time we also figured out how to reconize <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> communities: they took, but never gave back. Their interactions were very limited. Like others, they would ask for something to be repeated during broadcasts, but, other than that, they never said anything. We figured that <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> communities were lurkers.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> Communities</h1>
 <p>In spite of being the cause of pushing us over the cliff, the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> sytem still existed, and was alive and well, in more than a few communties. There were still bosses. That is what most people knew from pre-cliff days. If you are convinced that the <em>normal</em> thing is to submit, then that is the truth. Relatively, very few people understood that the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy was had brough us to this point. But if all you know is being fragile, then that is what you are comfortable in. And most people wanted to &ldquo;get back&rdquo; to comfort.</p>
 <p>The good news is that they, the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>, were shrinking. They managed to get out and they could easily joined other communities until they found one that felt right, more aligned to what they were looking for.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> had been known to threatened their neighbors because their people back.<a><sup>&hairsp;&hairsp;</sup></a> (a reference to episode xx.)</p>
