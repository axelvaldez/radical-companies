 <p>It took effort, but it didn't take long. We were used to competition and domination, but it killed us. Restarting from near scratch actually helped.</p>

<h1>The Salt of the Earth</h1>
 <p>It seemd to me that the salt battery was the fulcrum that helped us bolt forward. It was developed by a small community in Australia, a continent that was almost uninhabitable because it was so hot. They shared instructions of how to make them over the voice network which had painstankingly come together. Soon, communities throughout the world shared their improvements. We had renewable enerby storage systems that ensembles of commuities could build on.</p>
 <p>Then a community from South America that had sprung up around what use to be the border of Peru and Chile shared that they had a rudimentary form of <em>energy harvesting</em>; they had built the technology to capture ambient energy from the environment. The platform for the sodium-sulphur battery came in very handy for energy harvesting and the responses came in <em>very</em> rapidly. The whole world was working together and coming up with tangible results that communities and ensembles of communities could build.</p>
 <p>The salt battery and energy harvesting were the results, we could build on them, but what started it all were decentralization and transparency; fearless sharing and no need for secrecy; the playfulness that allowed us to experiement and learn; communities making it all meaningful and joyful; collaboratioon instead of ruthless competition.</p>
 <p> No place for domination: ranking is now dynamic, a function of contributions.</p>

<h1>The <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span> Economy</h1>
 <p>Nevertheless we needed money. Well, not <span class="_paradigm">FIAt</span> money. We needed &ldquo;a medium of exchange&rdquo; that would work anywhere in the world. We didn&rsquo;t have banks and, actually, we didn&rsquo;t want banks. We needed a different model. And <a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/07/rcoin.html" target="_blank"><span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s were it</a>. <span href="_paradigm">FIAT</span> money was a unit of measure for exchange and accumulation and it was anonymous and opaque. A "honest" dollar looked the same as a "not-so-honest" and there was no way to tell. <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s avoided all those problems and it supported world-wide exchange.</p>
 <p>A world-wide exchange would was decentralized that could nurture the next stage of innovation and accomplishment, the ultimate pricing engine.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s could be minted in a decentralized way, so no need for national governments</p>
 <p>As opposed to the old money, <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s are transparent. An integral part of each <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span> is a open log that comes and people made choices based on that information. Local communities backed <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s by accepting them because they usually knew the people minting them or they knew people who knew the people misting them. In any case, they needed them to succeed and move the world forward.</p>
