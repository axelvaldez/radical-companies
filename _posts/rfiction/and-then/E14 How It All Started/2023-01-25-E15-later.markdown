 <p>It took effort, but it didn't take long. We were used to competition and domination, but it killed us. Restarting from near scratch actually helped.</p>

<h1>Salt of the Earth</h1>
 <p>It seemd to me that the salt battery was the fulcrum that helped us bolt forward. It was developed by a small community in Australia, a continent that was almost uninhabitable because it was so hot. They shared instructions of how to make them over the voice network which had painstankingly come together. Soon, communities throughout the world shared their improvements. We had renewable enerby storage systems that ensembles of commuities could build on.</p>
 <p>Then a community from Punta Arenas shared that they had a rudimentary form of <em>energy harvesting</em> and could capture ambient energy from the environment. The platform that had come up for the sodium-sulphur battery came in very handy for the energy harvesting technology and the responses came in <em>very</em> rapidly. The whole world was working together and coming up with tangible results that communities and ensembles of communities could build on.</p>
 <p>The salt battery and energy harvesting were the results, we could build on them. But what started it all were decentralization and transparency; fearless sharing and no need for secrecy; the playfulness that allowed us to experiment and learn; communities making it all meaningful and joyful; collaboration instead of ruthless competition.</p>

<h1>World-Wide <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s</h1>
 <p>Nevertheless we needed money. Well, not <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> money, but we needed &ldquo;a medium of exchange&rdquo; that would work anywhere in the world. We didn&rsquo;t have banks and, actually, we didn&rsquo;t want banks. We needed a different model, and <a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/05/07/rcoin.html" target="_blank"><span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s were <em>it</em></a>.</p>
 <p><span href="_paradigm">FIAT</span> money was a unit of measure for exchange and accumulation; on top of that it was anonymous and opaque. This meant that a &ldquo;honest&rdquo; dollar looked the same as a &ldquo;not-so-honest&rdquo; dollar. <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s avoided all those problems and it supported decentralized world-wide exchange that could nurture the next stage of innovation.</p>
 <p>Each <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span> came with an open log that details who minted them, what, if anything, is backing them, and other information that people could use to decide to accept them or not. Communities accepted <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s because they usually knew the people minting them or they knew people who knew the people minting them. Most importantly, communities wanted them to succeed and move their world forward.</p>
