 <p>We headed for the cliff, and it was very comfortable ride. Then we went over the cliff, and going down was uncomfortable. But we survived.</p>

<h1>And Then&hellip; What?</h1>
 <p>&ldquo;We headed for the cliff, and it was very comfortable ride. Then we went over the cliff.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Luckily, when we hit the bottom, we were out of gas, so no explosion. Going down was bumpy, but we survived. Unfortunately, the anthropocene didn&rsquo;t quite make it in one piece and we had to start from scratch.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Well, not quite. We knew what we knew, and we could start <em>there</em>.&rdquo; As he said that, Zep pointed to his head. &ldquo;So, that what we did. If we didn&rsquo;t lose our head, we use it.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>With that Zep got up and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I am going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>&ldquo;We know what&ldquo;s next!&rdquo; the kids yelled.</p>
 <p>Without looking back, Zep responded, &ldquo;Good. Someobody else can finish it then.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Some of the kids got up and the whole group bantered some more, but eventually most headed to sleep. Three of them stayed and finished their version of the story.</p>

<h1>Stories</h1>
 <p>I say story because it wasn&rsquo;t recorded history. Zep was pre-cliff and even he who lived through it all told different stories about it. But alwasy based on the same facts. He insisted on doing this way and by that process showing all who listened that they could, nay, must think for themselves and figure out what stories were true and which were bullshit. The facts were the enchilada and the stories the sauce. Zap&rsquo;s storytelling style taught other to tell nourishing stories from empty-caliries stories.</p>
 
<h1>The Facts</h1>
 <p>The facts were that we were taken apart our life support system, otherwise know as the Earth.</p>
 <p>We talked, and talked, about climate change, nut nothing significant was done. We kept waiting, and waited, for powerful people to do what they were supposed to, but it all came to naught. We had lots of options that could have softened the blow, but they got lost among the national politics sutff.</p>
 <p>Instead of lowering fossil fuel extraction, it went higher and climate change went up. It went from &ldquo;change&rdquo; to &ldquo;disaster.&rdquo; But profits went up, and even salaries went up, so nobody complained. At least, nobody with a voice. &ldquo;The governments will clean up later.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>But instead of cleaning up, national governments kept up the soap opera and people became more polarized. Small nations didn&rsquo;t have the wherewithall to do much and rich countries were too focus on keeping up the profits and didn&rsquo;t do what they could have.</p>

<h1>We Went Over</h1>
 <p>We headed for the cliff, at full speed and we kept smiling and ccelerating. Then we went over. And then the dystopian movie started to roll.</p>
 <p>Something was not quite the same, however. There was something else in the real life script. The expected violent gangs were there. Also, present were the <span calss="_paradigm">FIAT</span> communities, ruled by a boss and his acolytes. But there were also a lot of small communities that co-managed themselves and shared everything they owned. Although, come to think of it, not so surprising because there was not much they owned and there were so small that they could easily co-manage.</p>
 <p>What was really surprising is that these communities had a written foundation. Even more suprising, it pretty much this foundation was word-for-word the same for everyone of them,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Meaning & Belonging</li>
   <li>Decentralization & Transparency</li>
   <li>Experimentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Meaning and belonging was about people. What made people people was that their actions were meaningful to the community they belonged to. These communities had to work for all involved, or else they&rsquo;d leave.</p>
  <p>Decentralization and transparence where their highest commitments. Anybody could ask, &ldquo;will that make us more or less decentralzed?&rdquo; Some communities had retreated to more and more centralization, more opaqueness. But many more were getting more decentralization or more transparent as they grew. And how they grew!</p>
  <p>Above all, they only had one gractice: experiementationk, which fit the post-cliff world perfectly.</p>
