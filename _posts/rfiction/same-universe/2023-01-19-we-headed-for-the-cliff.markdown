 <p>We headed for the cliff and it was very comfortable ride. Then we went over the cliff. Bumpy, but we survived.</p>

<h1>And Then&hellip; What?</h1>
 <p>&ldquo;We headed for the cliff, and it was very comfortable ride. Then we went over the cliff.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Luckily, when we hit the bottom, we were out of gas, so no explosion. Going down was bumpy, but we survived. Unfortunately, the anthropocene didn&rsquo;t quite make it in one piece and we had to start from scratch.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Well, not quite. We knew what we knew, and we could start <em>there</em>.&rdquo; As he said that, Zep pointed to his head. &ldquo;So, that is what we did. If we didn&rsquo;t lose our heads, we used them.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about you,&rdquo; Zep said as he got up, &rlquo;but <em>I</em> am going to sleep.&rdquo;
 <p>&ldquo;We know what&ldquo;s next!&rdquo; the kids yelled. &ldquo;We know how it ends!&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Without looking back, Zep responded, &ldquo;Good. Someobody else can finish it then.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Some of the kids got up and the whole group bantered some more, but eventually most headed to sleep. Three of them stayed and finished their version of the story.</p>

<h1>Stories</h1>
 <p>I say <em>story</em> because it wasn&rsquo;t <em>recorded</em> history. Even though Zep had live lived through, he told different stories about it. But alwasy based on the same facts. He insisted on doing this way and showing all who listened that they must think for themselves and figure out which stories were true and which were not. The facts were the enchilada, the nutritional suff. The stories were the sauce. After listening to one of Zap&rsquo;s many stories, you had to figure out which was nourishing and which empty-calories.</p>
 
<h1>The Facts</h1>
 <p>The facts were that we took apart our life support system.</p>
 <p>We made grand speeches and talked at length about climate change. Carboncredits and regulations were all gamed and nothing significant was done. We demanded and waited for powerful people to do what they were supposed to, but it all came to naught. We had lots of options that could have softened the blow, but they got lost among national politics stuff.</p>
 <p>Instead of lowering fossil fuel extraction, it went higher and the climate got hotter. It went from &ldquo;climate change&rdquo; to &ldquo;climate disaster.&rdquo; But profits and salaries went up, so nobody complained. &ldquo;The governments will clean up later.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Rather than take action, national governments kept up the soap opera and people became more confused, more polarized. Small nations didn&rsquo;t have the wherewithall to do much and rich countries were too focused on their wealth and didn&rsquo;t do what they could have.</p>

<h1>We Went Over</h1>
 <p>We headed for the cliff, at full speed, and we kept smiling and accelerating.</p>
 <p>Then we went over.</p>
 <p>And then the dystopian movie started to roll. Something was not quite the same, however. There was something else in the real life script.</p>
 <p>The expected violent gangs were there. Also, present were the <span calss="_paradigm">FIAT</span> communities, ruled by a boss and his acolytes. This was not surprising.</p>
 <p>But there were also a lot of small communities that shared everything they owned and with decentralized leadership. At first this didn&rsquo;t seem so surprising because there was not much they owned and there were so small that they could easily co-manage.</p>
 <p>What was really surprising is that these communities had written foundations. Even more suprising, their foundation were pretty much copies of each other,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Meaning & Belonging</li>
   <li>Decentralization & Transparency</li>
   <li>Experimentation</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>I finally figured out that meaning and belonging were about people. As a young womam told me, &ldquo;What makes people people is that their actions are meaningful to all of use. The community has to work for all involved, or else they&rsquo;d leave.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>The rest of them became obvious.</p>
 <p>Decentralization and transparence where their highest commitments. Anybody challenge any decision. &ldquo;Will that make us more or less decentralzed?&rdquo; Some communities had retreated to more and more centralization, more opaqueness. But many more were getting more decentralized and more transparent as they grew. And how they grew! </p>
 <p>Above all, they only had one gractice: experiementationk, which fit the post-cliff world perfectly.</p>
