 <p>The town I lived in has the first <span class="_paragigm">RADICAL</span> company. A delicious pastry shop, and my favorite store, of all places. In fact, it is truly the first <span class="_paragigm">RADICAL</span> company I know of.</p>

<h1>All Smiles</h1>
 <p>I met Christina on her first day at the shop. She was all smiles and we got to talk about her day and her boyfriend and her life. She mentioned that she did&rsquo;t know any other Christinas. As it happened, we want down the street, walked into a new plat shop, and, what do you know we met another youg woman named Christina (and, yes, my wife and I always exchnage names with the new people we meet). But I digress.</p>
 <p>A couple of days later I went back into the shop and Christina was there again, and all smiles.</p>

<h1>Y pasó el tiempo, y pasó&hellip;</h1>
 <p>I kept going to the shop for my favorite pastries, chocolate eclairs, and Anita, my wife, and I got to know Christina more. At one point she mentioned that she loved to read, so next time I brought her a copy of my book.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Among other things, the book talks about co-ownership&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I wanted her to read about.</p>
 <p>I didn&rsquo;t know then, the timing could not have been better.</p>

<h1>Marchons, Oui Marchons</h1>
 <p>The owners had already been talking about going to live back in France, at least for a good part of the year. They like the town they ended up in, but they liked their town, Ginoles les bains, back in France best. Not many prospects there, but now they had made enough money to not have to worry about that. There was even a semi-abandoned bathhouse-hotel property which they could restore and rent it for income.</p>
 <p>The anchor was their pastry shop in our town. They had built it from the ground up. They had made financially succesful. They could not just <em>sell it</em>. Fiding a manager was nearly impossible and the few they had talked to would not cut it. Selling to their employees was unfeasible, too, because they were mostly young people working part-time orsummers. Theere were a couple of employees that could be it, but they didn&rsquo;t have enough capital and would likely not be able to borrow it from any bank.</p>
 <p>Things were at impasse, but they were not desperate or in a hurry.</p>

<h1>Not Smiling</h1>
 <p>Two days after I gave her the book, Christina was not smiling. She wasn&rsquo;t even working, but there she was, waiting for me. Evidently I had gone into the show every Wednesday before 8:30 am, because they were gone after 8:30 am, and picked up three chocolate eclairs. And, yes, I have a sweet tooth, double down when it comes to chocolate, so sue me.</p>
 <p>In any case, there she was, Christina. She waved hello with a forced smile and I got my eclairs. As I was going out, I started to wave at her. Instead of waving back she stood up in front of me and stopped me. <span class="_quotespan">Do you have a minute?</span> she asked. Seeing how anxious she looked, I asked <span class="_quotespan">Are you working now?</span> and she responded by shaking her head. <span class="_quotespan">Why don&rsquo;t we walk outside?</span></p>
 <p>We stepped out and walked a bit in silence. Then, as soon as we passed the theater, she turned to me and said, <span class="_quotespan">Is your book fiction? It didn&rsquo;t sound like fiction at first, but then it got wierd. Totatly weird! So, I am assuming the weird part is totally fiction, right?</span></p>
 <p>I was kind of dumbfounded for a bit, but then I asked her, <span class="_quotespan">So you read it all in two days?</span> She shooked her head up and down. <span class="_quotespan">You are the fastest reader I know!</span> I said smiling.</p>

<h1>Still Anxious</h1>
 <p>No matter my attempted joke, she looked anxious. <span class="_quotespan">OK&hellip; So you read about co-management and co-ownership, right? And you know that I founded a company that was co-managed from day one and for fifteen years thereafter, right?</span> I got the same up and down shake from her <span class="_quotespan">So, co-management is real, right?</span> She hesitated for bit and then she said, <span class="_quotespan">Yeah, it is the same as self-management, right? I found lots of that stuff in Google. Actually, I think you are the only one that calls it co-management. But that is not the weird part and the book explains that the &lsquo;self&rsquo; stuf, and whya business cannot have a &lsquo;self&rsquo; that manages it<em>self</em>. I got all that, but that&rsquo;s not the weird part.</span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">OK, OK. So the co-management stuff is good, but the co-ownership stuff is the totally weird part. And you are right, co-ownership has not been implemented anywhere and you can all it fiction. But it is practical and it&rsquo;s doable, it is not utopian in any way. In fact, I am an investor in a company that is transitioning, slowly, to co-ownership. And I am about to start another company with my friend, Jose C, and that one is going to be co-owned from the get go.</span></p>
 <p><span class="_speakera">You are going to start a company? But&hellip;</span></p>
 <p><span class="_speakerb">You can say it&hellip; go ahead&hellip;</span></p>
 <p><span class="_speakera">Aren&rsquo;t you too old for that kind of stuff?</span></p>
 <p><span class="_speakerb">You are never too old for anything, except perhaps jumping out of a moving plane. Not if your body is up to it.</span></p>
 <p><span class="_speakera">Sorry&hellip;</span></p>
 <p><span class="_speakerb">No, no worries. It is what a lot of people believe, even and surprisingly in this Valley.</span> She looked a bit less anxious now <span class="_speakerac">Back to co-ownership, what questions do you have? I may not have answers, but questions are a good place to start.</span></p>
