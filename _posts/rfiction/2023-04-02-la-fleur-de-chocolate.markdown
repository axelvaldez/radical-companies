<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The town I lived in has the first <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company. A delicious pastry shop, and my favorite store, of all places. In fact, it is truly the first <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company I know of.</p>

<h1>All Smiles</h1>
 <p>I met Christina on her first day at the shop. She was all smiles and we got to talk about her day and her boyfriend and her life. She mentioned that she did&rsquo;t know any other Christinas. As it happened, we want down the street, walked into a new plat shop, and, what do you know we met another youg woman named Christina (and, yes, my wife and I always exchnage names with the new people we meet). But I digress.</p>
 <p>A couple of days later I went back into the shop and Christina was there again, and all smiles.</p>

<h1>Y pasó el tiempo, y pasó&hellip;</h1>
 <p>I kept going to the shop for my favorite pastries, chocolate eclairs, and Anita, my wife, and I got to know Christina more. At one point she mentioned that she loved to read, so next time I brought her a copy of my book.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Among other things, the book talks about co-ownership&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I wanted her to read about.</p>
 <p>I didn&rsquo;t know then, the timing could not have been better.</p>

<h1>Marchons, Oui Marchons</h1>
 <p>The owners had already been talking about going to live back in France, at least for a good part of the year. They like the town they ended up in, but they liked their town, Ginoles les bains, back in France best. Not many prospects there, but now they had made enough money to not have to worry about that. There was even a semi-abandoned bathhouse-hotel property which they could restore and rent it for income.</p>
 <p>The anchor was their pastry shop in our town. They had built it from the ground up. They had made financially succesful. They could not just <em>sell it</em>. Fiding a manager was nearly impossible and the few they had talked to would not cut it. Selling to their employees was unfeasible, too, because they were mostly young people working part-time orsummers. Theere were a couple of employees that could be it, but they didn&rsquo;t have enough capital and would likely not be able to borrow it from any bank.</p>
 <p>Things were at impasse, but they were not desperate or in a hurry.</p>

<h1>Not Smiling</h1>
 <p>Two days after I gave her the book, Christina was not smiling. She wasn&rsquo;t even working, but there she was, waiting for me. Evidently I had gone into the show every Wednesday before 8:30 am, because they were gone after 8:30 am, and picked up three chocolate eclairs. And, yes, I have a sweet tooth, double down when it comes to chocolate, so sue me.</p>
 <p>In any case, there she was, Christina. She waved hello with a forced smile and I got my eclairs. As I was going out, I started to wave at her. Instead of waving back she stood up in front of me and stopped me. <span class="_quotespan">Do you have a minute?</span> she asked. Seeing how anxious she looked, I asked <span class="_quotespan">Are you working now?</span> and she responded by shaking her head. <span class="_quotespan">Why don&rsquo;t we walk outside?</span></p>
 <p>We stepped out and walked a bit in silence. Then, as soon as we passed the theater, she turned to me and said, <span class="_quotespan">Is your book fiction? It didn&rsquo;t sound like fiction at first, but then it got wierd. Totatly weird! So, I am assuming the weird part is totally fiction, right?</span></p>
 <p>I was kind of dumbfounded for a bit, but then I asked her, <span class="_quotespan">So you read it all in two days?</span> She shooked her head up and down. <span class="_quotespan">You are the fastest reader I know!</span> I said smiling.</p>

<h1>Still Anxious</h1>
 <p>No matter my attempted joke, she looked anxious. <span class="_quotespan">OK&hellip; So you read about co-management and co-ownership, right? And you know that I founded a company that was co-managed from day one and for fifteen years thereafter, right?</span> I got the same up and down shake from her <span class="_quotespan">So, co-management is real, right?</span> She hesitated for bit and then she said, <span class="_quotespan">Yeah, it is the same as self-management, right? I found lots of that stuff in Google. Actually, I think you are the only one that calls it co-management. But that is not the weird part and the book explains the &ldquo;self&rdquo; stuff, and why a business doesn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;self&rdquo; and cannot managed it<em>self</em>. I got all that, but that&rsquo;s not the weird part.</span></p>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">OK, OK. So co-management is OK, but the co-ownership stuff is the totally weird part.</span> I exhaled and then I went on, <span class="_quotespan">then, you are right, co-ownership has not been implemented anywhere and you can all it fiction. But it is practical and it&rsquo;s doable, and not utopian. It is not yet fully implemeted and there are no examples. Yet. But it is happening. I am investing in a company that is transitioning, slowly, to co-ownership. And I am about to start company with a friend that is going to be co-owned from the get go.</span></p>

<h1>Surprisingly!</h1>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Whoa&hellip; you&rsquo;re going to start a company? &hellip;</span> She tried not to, but she looked confused as she said it.</p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">You can say it. Go ahead&hellip;</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Aren&rsquo;t you&hellip; old for that kind of stuff?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">You meant <em>old</em>. Well, if your body is up to it, you are never too old for anything, except maybe jumping out of a moving plane.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Sorry&hellip;</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">No, no worries. It is what a lot of people believe, even, and <span class="_me">surprisingly</span>, in this Valley.</span> She wasn&rsquo;t confused anymore and she looked less anxious now. <span class="_speakerbc">Getting back to the totally weird part, co-ownership, what questions do you have? I may not have answers, but questions are a good place to start.</span></p>

<h1>The Question</h1>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">I have a million questions.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Pick one.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">OK&hellip; how do we pay the owners what they want for the store?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">I don&rsquo;t know, exactly. You can borrow from a bank,</span>  she was slightly shaking her head sideways. <span class="_speakerbc">But I take it that&rsquo;s not an option. Or you can pay them in installments, from the wealth the store creates by selling chocalete eclairs and all that.</span> Then it dawned on me, <span class="_speakerbc">Wait&hellip; did you leaped to this question by yourself? or have you already talked about it with&hellip; your co-workers?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Well, the owners talked to a few people. And we asked them and Vicky told us that the owners were thinking of moving back to France and selling the store, but that they would really want to sell it to us, at least some of us. I was through most of the second section of your book so I re-read the rest of it as fast as I could and then I read the last two thirds again and&hellip; here we are.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Holly sh&hellip; what <em>timing</em>.</span></p>

<h1>Children of <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span></h1>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">There is another option. You could borrow part of it to pay the owners right away and pay the rest in installments. And I don't mean, from a bank, borrow it as a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investment.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">What is that? How does it work? And what will they give us money when we are all broke.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">How much do they want?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">I don&rsquo;t think Vicky knows, either.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Then that&rsquo;s your homework. We have to know.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Can I tell the others, maybe not all of them, but the more trustworthy one?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Yes, let&rsquo;s do as the book says and be transparent. However, given the system that we live in, you should probably ask the owner directly and then tell your co-workers.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">But what if they ask if I have the money to buy it and stuff like that?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Good point. Then, if they do, tell them that I might be interested. I am.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Do you have a lot of money?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Probably not enough, but, given the system we live in, I have credibility.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">We live in the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system, right?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Yep!</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Got it!</span></p>

<h1>The Meeting</h1>
 <p>We went through the niceties and the hellos and then there was the silence of not knowing how to start. So, I started.</p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">I am sorry to surprise you with the news that I knew about your plans, but there is a valid and innocent reason&hellip;</span> And I went on to explain.</p>
 <p>After my explanation, the man seemed more relaxed and the woman offered coffee. This time I accepted to give time to digest. In the meantime I told the man that I had been to Ginole les bains and found it beautiful and very relaxing.</p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Did you stat in town? Where?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">At the old bathhouse.</span> At the sound of that, he leaned forward as if to ask something, but he was interrupted by his wife coming back with the coffee.</p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerc">Black and no cream, right?</span> She said in a happy tone.</p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Right! Thanks.</span></p>
 <p>She sat down with a nervous smile on her face and glanced at her husband.</p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">We have not decided to sell, yet. We haven&rsquo;t even gone out to look for buyers.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">But you prefer to sell it to your employees.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerc">Yes!</span> Said the woman right away. <span class="_speakercc">And you are not our employee.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">That&rsquo;s OK, because I don&rsquo;t want to buy it. I am here to find out the financial terms and, if need be, to loan them money.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Oh.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">M&rsquo;dieu!</span></p>
 <p>They both looked worried now.</p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerc">We were going to tell them anyway. In fact&hellip;<span> She glanced at her husband and he subtly signaled agreement with his eyes, <span class="_speakercc">We prefer to tell them ourselves.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">That would be best. I felt akward coming here anyways. Not let me explain what I see as my involvement</span>&mdash;I paused for a bit and thought about what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it&mdash;<span class="_speakerbc">I intend to help them out with the finances, the money part, but I don&rsquo;t want to expect any pwer over the company in any way. Except, maybe, they should reserve three chocaolate eclairs from me.</span> Finally, we all got to smile and relax a bit.</p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">What do you mean you don&rsquo;t want any power for your money?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Hmm. This may sound weird to you, but I am more interested in the success of them and the community, our town. I&rsquo;ll give them what I call a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investment, which means that they have to pay back the principle, the amount of money I give them, plus something else. I've made a couple of these investments before and the something else is that we take my interest, usually 10%, and the co-owners match it. We end up with 20% of the investmet in a pool and then distribute it to everybody based on their&hellip; contributions.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerc">And then you decide? or they vote? How do you decided their contributions? Besides, waiting until the very end&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think that works!</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Yes, to everythig you said. But, no, that is not quite the way it works.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Then, how does it work?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">OK, you are interested, so I'll give you the whole tour of how <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s work.</span></p>

<h1>Contibutions</h1>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Go ahead. We are interested.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">OK&hellip; <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are not digital money or anthing like that. But, forget that for now! Let&rsquo;s start with <em>contributions</em>. Normally. you do something good, the boss notices, and he gives you a pat on the back. If he likes you, he may even give you a promotion later. That makes it more tangible, right? But what do you do when you are all owners <em>and there is no boss</em>&hellip;</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Not a boss? That doesn&rsquo;t work&hellip;</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerc">Cher, that is how we run the front of the store, n&rsquo;est pa?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Yes, but not really.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerc">Yes, really. We train them and then they take over the store. They ask some questions, but they do very well on their own.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">OK, but you can&rsquo;t run the bakery that without a baker.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Yes, you'll have to have a baker. Maybe they all become bakers.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Oof.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">That is how Arizmendi works.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">The hippie bakery in San Francico.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">That one. It is very successful and very profitable.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">And it gives me a headache.</span></p>
 <p>She looked at him sternly and then she turned to me,</p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerc">Actually, we tried that, but it didn't work. It ended up being very chaotic.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Yes, it can happen, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to. I am the cofounder of a business that is over 800 people now, but it has no bosses, it is very profitable, and it is not chaotic at all.</span></p>
 <p>That made them sit up. I guess I had credibility with them now.</p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">So, what happens without a boss.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">People recognize each other&rsquo;s contributions directly.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">What are the rules?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">There are no rules. Whatever a person feels is a contribution, is a contribution.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerc">Say more.</span></p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s</h1>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">The contributions that you give reflect how you feel about what you see happening. You see behavior, you feel enthused about it, and you press the &ldquo;contributions&rsquo; button to your heart&rsquo;s content. You see behavior, you feel it is wrong, and you press the &ldquo;we need to talk&rsquo; button. But we want these contributions to be tangible, not empty backslaps. To make them tangible, you have to convert them to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. If you give somebody 10% of all the contributions you given out this month and you have $100, they get $10, but if you hade $1,000, they&rsquo;d get $100. Rather tan converting directly to dollars or euroes, we convert to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. Later when, say, revenue comes in, that revenue is distributed according to the numbers of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s you have. If you have twice as many rads as me, you get twice as much of that revenue as me.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerc">Still, it sounds very complicated.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">It is different, but not that complicated. Money is more complicated, except that the machinery is hidden to you and me.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerc">That is true, but it still sounds complicated.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">People earn one <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> per day. Not to keep, but to give them out to their peers. At the end of, say, each month your contributions get converted to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s and then something tangible, say, revenue comes in. The expenses are paid and what is left normally goes to the owner. In this case, what is left, the dividends, get distributed according to the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> you have. There a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s! mobile app that takes care of that, the &ldquo;complication&rdquo;</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakera">Aha, there is an app&hellip;</span> He let out a full laugh, <span class="_speakerac">THERE IS AN APP FOR THAT!</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb">Yes. It let&rsquo;s you recognize contributions when you see them. This means that you don&rsquo;t have to wait until the end of month to vote. And you don't have to convert contributions to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s&mdash;the app does that. Finally, it records all transactions so everybody can see them.</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerc">Can I take <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s away?</span></p>
 <p class="_speaker"><span class="_speakerb"><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are given for contributions, so unless the contributions were fake, it doesn't make sense to take <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s away. You might be asking if there a way to <em>punish</em> somebody, is that it? And the answer to that is no. But there is an option to ask to &ldquo;have a talk&rdquo; instead of giving them <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. If he offending behavior persists and you and your peers stop given the person <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, eventually they will leave.</span></p>
