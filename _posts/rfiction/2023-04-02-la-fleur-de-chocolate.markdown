 <p>The town I lived in has the first <span class="_paragigm">RADICAL</span> company. A retail store, of all places. A delicious pastry shop, and my favorite. In fact, it is truly the first <span class="_paragigm">RADICAL</span> company I know of.</p>

 <p>The town I lived in has the first <span class="_paragigm">RADICAL</span> company. A retail store, of all places. A delicious pastry shop, and my favorite. In fact, it is truly the first <span class="_paragigm">RADICAL</span> company I know of. The whole thing started innocently enough.</p>

<h1>All Smiles</h1>
 <p>I met Christina on her first day at the shop. She was all smiles and we got to talk about her day and her boyfriend and her life. She mentioned that she did&rsquo;t know any other Christinas. As it happened, we want down the street, walked into a new plat shop, and, what do you know we met another youg woman named Christina (and, yes, my wife and I always exchnage names with the new people we meet). But I digress.</p>
 <p>A couple of days later I went back into the shop and Christina was there again, and all smiles.</p>
