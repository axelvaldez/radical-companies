<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Developed with good intentions, the fomula had been a money-maker for years. But it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <div class="_speakera">Nothing is enough!</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Calm down. We just need to get the return our owners expect.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">What about telling them that their expectactions is modulated by what people can afford. And as it is they are paying over 100 times what it costs to developed and make our drugs.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">But that is the point, there is an opportunity to get higher returns. The window has opened to raise our prices. What is wrong with that?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">What is wrong with it is that it is an artificial &lsquo;opportunity.&rsquo; The window that you are talking about is something that we are making up!</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Wait, it is not just us&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Right, it is not just us. We are all raising prices <span class="_me">because we can</span>.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Which will result in higher levels of returns thir fiscal year than last fiscal year.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I see that your mind is made up and my participation is cosmetic. I came prepared for that.</div>
 <div class="_commentary">David took out an envelope and pushed it towards the power end of the table.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">This is my letter of resignation. You can send my stuff to my house, later on. Or keep it, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">David, calm down. We are not accepting&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_commentary">As the words kept cascading down from the power end of the table, David got up and walked out.</div>

<h1>What&rsquo;s Next?</h1>
 <div class="_speakera">It wasn&rsquo;t the first time, and they will keep doing it. There is no bottom to their &lsquo;fiduciary&rsquo; greed.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Well, you did it. Let&rsquo;s take some time off as we said and figure out what is next. OK?</div>

<h1>The Epiphany</h1>
 <div>Less than a week later, they had it. David have come running from the nearby lake into the cabin they had rented. As Th&uacute;y managed to slow him down she, too, became excited: they were going to start a new company to do pharmaceutical research based on David&rsquo;s brand-as-fortune and Th&uacute;y&rsquo;s business experience and energy.</div>
 <div>Then David started to hesitate, afraid that his previous company was going to come after them and make their lives impossible. They would be stopped dead in their tracks even before they had a chance to do anything. Th&uacute;y gave him a deep, sustained hug.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">David&hellip; David! They won&rsquo;t come after you if you are not in competition with them. They will laugh and let you fry in your own grease.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Fry in my&hellip; what? OK, OK, I get what you mean&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Once you announce that you are not raising any serious capital, they&rsquo;ll laugh. I did when you first said it, I did laugh. I was convinced that it would take a multimillion dollar lab to make any headway. Then you laughed and told me why not.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">And if they don&rsquo;t laugh, screw them. Plenty of people will come to my defense&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">&hellip; plenty of people will be sympathetic and that&rsquo;s it. Our biggest defense is that we are tiny and unimportant. That is the only thing we have going to us, OK?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">&lsquo;Tiny and unimportant&rsquo; &hellip; maybe that is what we should call it, TAU.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">TAU, UA.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Yeah. Whatever&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Don&rsquo;t be dissmisive: UA stands for <span class="_me">Unincorporated Association</span>. It is a new class of legal entity that does not include stock. There are no shares in the company. I do not think it exists outside California, but we can do business in every state of the union so long as we register it and pay taxes.</div>
 <div class="_speakerbc">The fact that we will be operating without stock will make them fall off their chairs with laughter. They may even offer to buy a percentage of the company so they can have a laugh.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I like it. But, isn&rsquo;t kind of &lsquo;not-so-funny&rsquo; to not have company stock? I mean, what do we do for growth?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">We are going to create a co-owned company, and run it as a co-managed company, too. I have read all about it. Growth will come and we will get the capital, but we won&rsquo;t give our power over the business.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">OK, I am listening&hellip;</div>

<h1>Impact</h1>
 <div class="_speakera">OK, I&rsquo;ll ask: what is a co-owned business?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Company. A co-owned <span class="_me">company</span>.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Company, business, whatever.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">No, no, no. Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;whatever.&rsquo; A business is meant to &lsquo;do business,&rsquo; do transactions, make money, be hyper-competitive like every other business. In any case, leave that to me. Trust me and don&rsquo;t have to worry about that, for now</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Yes, ma&lsquo;am. As you say.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">You are so dramatic sometimes&hellip; But, you are right. I said that with my boss hat on. The point is to get away from that and learn from each other.</div>
 <div class="_speakerbc">Let&rsquo;s start with why I insisted on calling it a &lsquo;company&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;business.&rsquo;</div>
 <div class="_speakerbc">A business, as I said, is a money-making machine and that&lsquo;s that. A company, on the other hand, is a community of people working together to have a bigger impact that they could on their own. Besides, the work &rsquo;company&lsquo; itself is a gem because it means a group of people who <span class="_me">break bread together.</span> Isn&lsquo;t that beautiful? We are going to create a space for a community of researchers working together to make a big impact. And also  be financially successful.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">How fine-anne-shelly successful</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Creating a co-owned company is a strategy, but it is not magic. It depends on our results. Will they be accepted, embraced? In the end, we may not be that fine-anne-shelly successfully, but that is the risk people always take when they start a business.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">A &lsquo;company,&rsquo; right?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">What?&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakera">You meant to say a &lsquo;company,&rsquo; not a &lsquo;bus&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">&hellip; Right! Hey, you are good at this.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">As I have said before, what I know doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance when it meets what I&rsquo;ve learned.</div>

<h1>Explicit Alignment</h1>
 <div>As they were formalizing their company, they got the box from the company with David&rsquo; personal items.</div>
 <div>By the end of the day they had created <span class="_paradigm">rHEALTH</span>. And, more importantly, they had come with what Th&uacute;y called their <em>Explicit Alignment</em>. This include their intended Impact, Purpose, and Mission. The Impact was very important because it would tell all future members WHAT they were signing up FOR. The Purpose tells them WHY they were doing it. The Mission was the most tentative because it will fit its shape to whatever team they assembled so what they wrote sketched out WHAT they were going to do, WHEN, and HOW.</div>
 <div>David struggled with the process, he wanted a solid Mission, a definite goal that would tell the team what to strive for. Everything else was bullshit.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">I struggled with that, too. How will you get there if you don't know where you are going, right? That is <span class="_me">Justificatioon 101</span> for planning. But, think about it, if our Impact is to give people the opportunity to live a healthy live, is the Mission more important than that. Can you really say that the goal of the Mission is more important than giving people the opportunity to live healthy lives?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">But the Mission is the first step in getting to the Impact&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">You are smart, but you are not that smart. Can you falsify what you just said? Are you being a scientist or a boss?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Well, look, I am always a&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">I&lsquo;ve been a boss longer than you have, and that statement screams &rsquo;boss&lsquo; to me. We cannot afford to create obstacles for people to join the team and creating a &rsquo;solid Mission&lsquo; is creating an obstacle. Many people will ignore it because they want to work with you, they want to learn from you. But it is an obstacle that get bigger and bigger over time, until they quit to get away from it or submit to it and we all lose.</div>

<h1>Open Relationships</h1>
 <p>They had talked about what Th&uacute;y knew about Trust Relationship, and they were now working through one they found online. They would then be ready to ask future potential <span class="_paradigm">rHEALTH</span> to go through it, add their piece, and modifiy as needed.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I am still not clear on what co-owned company is.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">It is a company that is not owned by anybody in particular. It is owned by the peope who contribute to it.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">So, if we take time off, we are owners anymore? That doesn&rsquo;t seem right!</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Well, no, if we take time off&hellip; OK, time out, I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know about co-owned and co-managed companies. They are called <span class="_paradigm">RADIcAL</span> companies, by the way.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">So, that&rsquo;s what the little r stands for.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Yes, that. And the fact that <span class="_me">rhealth.com</span> was available and <span class="_me">health.com</span> was not.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Yes.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Co-management is similar to self-management but it is renamed to better reflect the fact that <span class="_me">people</span> do the management and not the company itself. There is no self when it comes to something like a company; people co-manage the company.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">OK.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Co-ownership&hellip; co-ownership sounded scary when I first heard about it. I had the questions you had plus a bunch of others. What I found so appealing was that it is ownership based on contributions, not capital. That means that anybody can be an owner! That blew my mind and at the same time brought up all kinds of fears. What if somebody pretends to do contribute? Can somebody steal all my work and claim it as their own?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Yeah an&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">&hellip; but the thing is that we gets to decide what is or isn&rsquo;t a contribution. Everybody in the company decides. I had to think about that for a bit. And then I got very, very angry,</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Why? I can ask why, right?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Because nobody had said so. Because it was invisible and then it became so obvious. We think of ourselves as so smart, but we never saw this&hellip; power? It was like a veil got lifted off and I could see clearly. I wanted to cry and punch the walls at the same time. I mean, WHY DO WE NEED BOSSES?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">OK, OK. Calm down. Drop a &rsquo;lude.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Oh, I am calmed. You should have seen me when I first realized it.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I think I did.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">I am OK now, better than ever, actually.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">So ownership is dynamic, not static.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">You&hellip; you say it so matter-of-fact. Like it is obvious&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Well, it is implied by what you just said. If you are constantly judging me, my worth in your eyes must change all the time. Nobody has a static view of other people.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">It&rsquo;s not your worth or anything like that, it is about what you did that struck me as a contribution to us as a community.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Yes, I understand, but if I do my best work and nobody sees that as a contribution, I am going to feel like crap. You may be judging based on my behavior, but I will internatize it as worth.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">If you are doing your best work and nobody notices, then you need to talk more. Or different. In any case, they need to learn why what you have done is so important.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Good point. And that is what a &lsquo;learning organization&rsquo; is all about, ain&rsquo;t it? Besides, it will bring other benefits along. People can ask better questions and not feel left out of it. They would be more playful and kick the ball more&hellip; shit, it would lead to more innovation. Holy Mackrel! So, how does it work?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">How does what work?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">The contribution thing. Are there rules? Who keeps track of them? What?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Oh, there is an app for that.</div>
 <div class="_commentary">David reached for his phone</div>
 <div class="_speakera">What&rsquo;s it called?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb"><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, with an exclamation mark at the end.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Got it&hellip; It looks awfully simple to use. Here, I&rsquo;ll invite you to <span class="_paradigm">rHEALTH</span>, but I first have to create it. Oh, wait, it already exists. I will ask for an invite from the lonely, lovely member.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">And&hellip; you are now a member of the <span class="_paradigm">rHEALTH</span> community!</div>
 <div class="_speakera">So, now&hellip; oh, I see, I press this button. And it&hellip; ejaculates stars every time I do.</div>
 <div class="_commentary">David laughed full throat. And, suddenly, he stopped laughing and looked down for a bit. Finally, he looked up, and said,</div>
 <div class="_speakera">This is going to change everything.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">If they don&rsquo;t throw us in jail to rot first.</div>

<h1>They Came</h1>
 <p>Recruiting</p>
 <p>People start to show up for David. Surprisingly, some don't want to do through the Relationship Storeys: too woo-woo for them. The more junior, the more excited. Three joing reluctantly.</p>
 <p>They worry about Th&uacute;y and nepotism.</p>
 <div class="_speakera">What about Th&uacute;y?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Well, she is your wife and will side with you more often than not.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">You are married, right?&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Not only that, she'll be deciding on salaries and bonus and stuff and she would have an ax to gring when it comes to you.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Bruno, you are very smart. Think. Salaries and anything to do with money is based on <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, right? And who gives me <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s? She does, but you guys do. If I get more than anybody else one month it must be because I did something really good&hellip; Right?</div>
 <div class="_speakerac">Besides, it is all out in the open and if there&rsquo;s some hanky panky, you will bring it up, right?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Yes. I get it in my head, but it is hard to shake the concerns&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Then don&rsquo;t. Just be open to their being fears that don&rsquo;t play here.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">And bonuses, too. I get it.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Well, they are not &rsquo;bonuses&lsquo;, you&rsquo;ve earned them. You contributed, people acknowledged those contributions, and you get Earned Dividends. The kind of stuff that <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> owners put in their pockets in <span class="_me">normal</span> business.</div>

<h1>And They Surprised</h1>
 <p>The most surprising thing was when, Siri wanted to talk. I assume that it was to gloat about something that she had found or to deliver and not-so-veiled threat. But, no, Siri wanted to join us. And I literally fell off my chair.</p>
 <div class="_speakera">Siri, to be honest, I am suprised, but, please, come by.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Well, it is not that easy for me. I don't want to be seen showing up at your place.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">There is no need. We can do it online.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">It would have to be early. I don&rsquo;t want to take the day off.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I may not be it, but you can go through the whole thing with one of the other folks.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Wait&hellip; Are you dissing me?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">No, Siri I am not dissing you. Would you like me to explain?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Look, Davey, I am not desperate or anything. I just want to talk to see if everything I hear is true and it has to come from you, because you are the big guy.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Let&rsquo;s do this, I will go through the whole thing with you and then you can decide what to do.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">I hope you won&rsquo;t raised your voice at me like when you worked here.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I hope I won&rsquo;t.</div>

<h1>A Real Curnocopia for Health</h1>
 <p>Because the all-sacred-margin was not as high priority as in <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> companies, compounds that could only would be used internally or just sit around not being used were now out there in the world. A lot of them were made available as Open Source. And at least two of them went into the development of drugs by businesses that would have never seen the light of day under the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> regime.</p>
 <p>Not having to maintain a veil secrecy, took a huge weight off our shoulders. There was no way to prove it, but transparency made everybody more productive. And happier.</p>

<h1>Fear Has Us</h1>
 <div class="_commentary">Fear has us.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">I am tired of being afraid, seeing how the FIAT model works has exposed the fears and has made all the difference.</div>
 <div class="_commentary">Well, that may be the beginning, but it is not the end of the hold that fear has on us. That became obvious over time as people expressed many of their fears, including toxic colleages&hellip;</div>
 <p></p>
 <div class="_speakerb">How are we going to deal with bullies, underminders, and slackers. What about gossip mongers and the over-controlling colleages. Are they going to be co-owners, too?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Well, if they contribute and somebody acknowledges their contribution, then they get <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s and they are co-owners.</div>
 <div class="_speakerac">As to the rest of it, how would you deal with these types of folks?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Should we have rules to prevent that?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">And who would enforce those rules. Are we using force to make sure those rules are followed?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Well, no&hellip; We don&rsquo;t want to use force, but we have to be ready for them.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">There is a mechanism to address these kinds of problem and it&rsquo;s right in your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s! app.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">You mean the button for <span class="_me">We need to talk</span>?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I think that&rsquo;s where it starts, yes.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Yeah, but that is a difficult conversation and I wouldn't know where to start.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">There are many people who can give you some tips&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Yes, you are right. Ask. Learn. Shit, this is so simple and we make things so complicated&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakera">That is what we learned to do, make things very complicated. And fear hides behind those complications.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">But I am not afraid&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Yet, you are letting your fears speak for you.</div>
 <div class="_commentary">He went quiet for a bit. Then he said,</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">I think I am going to talk to Anita about how to start this convesation without letting it turn into a fight.</div>
 
<h1>Myth Is Fear</h1>
 <div class="_speakerb">Hey, Dave, what should we work on next?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">I have no idea.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Well, you are the main inventor here and we were hoping you spilled some of your secret sauce on us.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">You don't have any secret sauce of your own?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Well, maybe, but not really. Not compared to yours.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Then I think you should go to the sea or the mountain or whereever it is that makes <span class="_quotespan">secret sauce</span> space for you.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">You don&rsquo;t have to take it so seriously&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Why, you weren&rsquo;t serious when you categorized yourself as a second-class co-onwer? Or maybe it was when you surrendered responsibility for what to do next? Which of those were not serious?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">I didn&rsquo;t say any of that.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">But you implied it. When you said that I was the main inventor, you put yourself down as a lesser inventor. Then you said that you weren&rsquo;t as good when compared to me, you were were offering for me to tell you what to do to avoid responsibility.</div>
 <div class="_speakerac">You, and Mike, and Steve. You are co-owners of what we are doing. The whole thing. If your secrect sauce could be made better, other co-owners will offer their own ideas. Imagine that: people being inspired by your secret saud and adding to it. Whoa! In the end, it is up to you folks to take their advice or not.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">It is a myth, isn&rsquo;t it? The whole thing about the lead inventor and all that. But we are so used to it&hellip; And we compete for it by not pointing out the weaknesses or what can be done better, easier.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Here we can, but we keep on going back to our&hellip; our&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Fears?</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Yes. I don&rsquo;t want to say that they have an inviolable hold over us, but they kind of do.</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Look at your fears. Rather than saying that you are not afraid of anything, look for the fear that is hiding behind that. If you can&rsquo;t do it by yourself, get other people to help you. Don&rsquo;t give in to the <span class="_quotespan">I can do it by myself</span> fear. Seek others to learn from and to help you. Be open to the receive love from people you dont know.</div>

<h1>A Spy</h1>
 <p>Zuri wrote an email coming out as a spy and sent it to everybody. It ended with, <span class="_quotespan">Are there other spies reading this?</span> That created enoiugh convufion that she then send a follow up email, <span class="_quotespan">I didn&rsquo;t mean to imply that there are more spies lurking among us. I just wanted to encourage others, if there was any, to come out. It seems I was the only one.</span></p>
 <div class="_commentary">The emails were remarkable in one way, and non-remarkable in many other ways.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Why would you need to be a spy when everything is out in the open?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">People suspected that this was more of a cult and it wasn&rsquo;t as sunny as all that. As it turned out, there was nothing to report other than what they new and what they could see. In the meantime, this company was well fit, excuse me, aligned with everything me.</div>
 <div class="_speakerac">By the way, this started right after Siri joined us. They thought they had golden cuffs on her, and they could not understand why she&rsquo;d leave all that money behind. They could not understand that there were other things besides money that she would value and made her happy. They asked her to come back and she reported that she was happy, doing the work she loved, and didn&rsquo;t have to deal with bureaucracy. David, she said, was pompous as always, but it didn&rsquo;t matter because he could not get in her way or stop her as he had done before. He was a co-owner, she was a co-owner, and they listened to each other. If anybody followed her, she would go ahead, but if nobody followed you wanted to find out why. She had learned tons that way and she found herself growing into a better person, and her family noticed, too.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">So, there weren&rsquo;t any other spies?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Not really. A couple of people told me that they had come to find out about the &lsquo;real&rsquo; <span class="_paradigm">rHEALTH</span> but found nothing, except it was a differente place and a different community. They stayed because of what they found here.</div>
 
<h1>Anne Shelly Does Fine</h1>
 <p>Against the expectations many had, <span class="_paradigm">rHEALTH</span> did financially well. Very well, actually. Many of their <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> competitors didn&rsquo;t know how to react to the price &lsquo;competition&rsquo;. Many ended up folding when they could not get the profits they expected. Others changed accepted lower profit levels for their investors and slowly changed their way.</p>
 <p>At one point, <span class="_paradigm">BANNERS</span> started to show up for investing in new companies. Th&uacute;y and Paloma, the other financial person in the company, did a lot of workshops to teach would be founders the mechanics of investing. Many of the new companies stayed Ensembled with <span class="_paradigm">rHEALTH</span> because they did related work, but a few others went on their own, including one that went into space. They didn&rsquo;t make rockets or any such, but they wanted people going to space to stay healthy, both in on and off planet Earth. It seemed that the science was different enough.</p>
 <p>The amazing point is that people were investing in other <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies. Investing had become easy. They didn&rsquo;t want to accumulate capital, they wanted to be part of creating things for all people. And that&hellip; that was more powerful.</p>
