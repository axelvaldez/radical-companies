<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Developed with good intentions, the fomula had been a money-maker for years. But it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p class="_speakera">Nothing is enough!</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Calm down. We just need to get the return our owners expect.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">What about telling them that their expectactions is modulated by the market?</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">But that is the point, there is an opportunity to get higher returns. The window has opened to raise our prices. What is wrong with that?</p>
 <p class="_speakera">What is wrong with it is that it is an artificial &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo;. The window that you are talking about is something that we are making up!</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Wait, it is not just us&hellip;</p>
 <p class="_speakera">Right, it is not just us. We are all raising prices <span class="_me">because we can</span>.</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Which will result in higher levels of returns thir fiscal year than last fiscal year.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">I see that your mind is made up and my participation is cosmetic. I came prepared for that.</p>
 <p>David took out an envelope and pushed it towards the power end of the table.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">This is my letter of resignation. You can send my stuff to my house, later on. Or keep it, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I don&rsquo;t want to cause a scene out there.</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Dave, calm down. We are not accepting&hellip;</p>
 <p>As the words kept cascading down from the power end of the table, David got up and walked out.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s Next?</h1>
 <p class="_speakera">It wasn&rsquo;t the first time, and they will keep doing it. There is no bottom to their &lsquo;fiduciary&rsquo; greed.</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Well, you did it. Let&rsquo;s take some time off as we said and figure out what is next. OK?</p>

<h1 style="margin:120px 0 20px 0;">The Epiphany</h1>
 <p>Less than a week later, they had it. Dave have come running from the nearby lake into the cabin they had rented. As Xin managed to slow him down she, too, became excited: they were going to start a new company to do pharmaceutical research based on David&rsquo;s brand-as-fortune and Xin&rsquo;s business experience and energy.</p>
 <p>Then David started to hesitate, afraid that his previous company was going to come after him and make their lives impossible and stopped them dead in their tracks even before they had a chance to do anything. Xin gave him a deep, sustained hug.</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">David&hellip; David! They won&rsquo;t come after you if you are not in competition with them. They will laugh and let you fry in your own grease.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">Fry in my&hellip; what? OK, OK, I get what you mean&hellip;</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Once you announce that you are not raising any serious capital, they&rsquo;ll laugh. I did when you first said it, I did laugh. I was convinced that it would take a multimillion dollar lab to make any headway. Then you laughed and told me why not.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">And if they don&rsquo;t laugh, screw them. Plenty of people will come to my defense&hellip;</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">&hellip; plenty of people will be sympathetic and that&rsquo;s it. Our biggest defense is that we are tiny and unimportant. That is the only thing we have going to us, OK?</p>
 <p class="_speakera">Tiny and unimportant&hellip; maybe that is what we should call it, TAU.</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">TAU, UA, for Unincorporated Association.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">Yeah. Whatever&hellip;</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Don&rsquo;t be dissmisive: UA stands for <span class="_me">Unincorporated Association</span>. It does not include stock, that is why it is an <span class="_me">Association</span>. There are no shares in the company. I do not think it exists outside California, but eventually it will.</p>
 <p class="_speakerbc">The fact that we will be operating without stock will make them fall off their chairs with laughter. They will probably offer to buy a percentage of the company, just to make it funnier.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">I like it. But, isn&rsquo;t kind of &lsquo;not-so-funny&rsquo; to not have company stock? I mean, what do we do for growth?</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">We are going to create a co-owned company, and run it as a co-managed company, too.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">OK, I am listening&hellip;</p>

<h1>Impact</h1>
 <p class="_speakera">I have to ask, what is a co-ownened business?</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Company. A co-owned <span class="_me">company</span>.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">Company, business, whatever.</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">No, not &lsquo;whatever.&rsquo; A business means to &ldquo;do business,&rsquo;, making transactions, be like anybody else. A company is a community of people working together to make an impact bigger that they could on their own. In fact, the work company itself is a gem. It means people who break bread together. We are going to create a community of researchers, who, by the way, will be financially successful.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">How fine-anne-shah-ly successful</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">It depends on how well our results are accepted and embraced. We may not be that fine-anne-shah-ly successfully. That is the risk. But that is the risk people always take when they start a business.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">A <span class="_me">company</span>, right?</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Right! Hey, you are good at this.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">I am very good at learning. I have said before, but that may be all that I am really good at. What I know doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance in front of what I learn.</p>
