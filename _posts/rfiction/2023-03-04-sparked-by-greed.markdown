<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Developed with good intentions, the fomula had been a money-maker for years. But it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p class="_speakera">Nothing is enough!</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Calm down. We just need to get the return our owners expect.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">What about telling them that their expectactions is modulated by the market?</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">But that is the point, there is an opportunity to get higher returns. The window has opened to raise our prices. What is wrong with that?</p>
 <p class="_speakera">What is wrong with it is that it is an artificial &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo;. The window that you are talking about is something that we are making up!</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Wait, it is not just us&hellip;</p>
 <p class="_speakera">Right, it is not just us. We are all raising prices <em>because we can</em>.</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Which will result in higher levels of returns thir fiscal year than last fiscal year.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">I see that your mind is made up and my participation is cosmetic. I came prepared for that.</p>
 <p>David took out an envelope and pushed it towards the power end of the table.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">This is my letter of resignation. You can send my stuff to my house, later on. I don&rsquo;t want to cause a scene out there.</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Dave, calm down. We are not accepting&hellip;</p>
 <p>As the words kept cascading down from the power end of the table, David got up and walked out.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s Next?</h1>
 <p class="_speakera">It wasn&rsquo;t the first time, and they will keep doing it. There is no bottom to their &lsquo;fiduciary&rsquo; greed.</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Well, you did it. Let&rsquo;s take some time off as we said figure out what is next.</p>

<h1>The Epiphany</h1>
 <p>Less than a week later, they had it. Dave have come running from the nearby lake into the cabin they had rented. As Xim managed to slow him down she, too, became excited: they were going to start a new company to do pharmaceutical research. David&rsquo;s brand as fortune combined with with Xin&rsquo;s experience and energy.</p>
 <p>Then David started to hesitate, afraid that his previous company was going to come after him and make their lives impossible and stopped them dead in their tracks even before they had a chance to do anything. Xin gave him a big, sustained hugg.</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">David&hellip; David! They won&rsquo;t come after you if you are not in competition with them. They will laugh and let you fry in your own grease.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">Fry in my&hellip; what? OK, OK, I get what you mean&hellip;</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Once you announce that you are not raising any serious capital, they&rsquo;ll laugh. I did when you first said it, I did laugh. I was convinced that it would take a multimillion dollar lab to make any headway. Then you laughed and told me why not.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">And if they don&rsquo;t laugh, screw them. Plenty of people will come to my defense&hellip;</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">&hellip; plenty of people will be sympathetic and that&rsquo;s it. Our biggest defense is that we are tiny and unimportant. That is the only thing we have going to us, OK?</p>
 <p class="_speakera">Tiny and unimportant&hellip; maybe that is what we should call it, TAU.</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">TAU, UA, for Unincorporated Association.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">Yeah. Whatever&hellip;</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">Don&rsquo;t be dissmisive: UA stands for <em>Unincorporated Association</em>. It does not include stock, that is why it is an <em>Association</em>. There are no shares in the company. I do not think it exists outside California, but eventually it will.</p>
 <p class="_continueb">The fact that we will be operating without stock will make them fall off their chairs with laughter. They will probably offer to buy a percentage of the company, just to make it funnier.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">I like it. But, it is kind of &lsquo;funny&rsquo;, in a not-so-funny way, to not have company stock, ain&rsquo;t it?</p>
 <p class="_speakerb">We are going to create a co-owned company, and run it as a co-managed company, too.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">OK, I am listening&hellip;</p>

<h1>Impact</h1>
 <p class="_speakera">What is a co-ownened business?</p>
 <p class="_speakera">Company. A co-owned <em>company</em>.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">Company, business, whatever.</p>
 <p class="_speakera">No, not &lsquo;whatever.&rsquo; A business restricts you to &ldquo;doing business,&rsquo; making transactions. A company is a community of people working together to make an impact bigger that they could on their own. By the way, the work company itself is a delight, too. It means people who break bread together, from &lsquo;con&rsquo; <em>together</em> and &lsquo;pan&rsquo; <em>bread</em>.
