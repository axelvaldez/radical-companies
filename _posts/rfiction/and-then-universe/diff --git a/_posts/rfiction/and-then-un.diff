 <h1><span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s</h1>
  <p>The bigger communities needed to represent exchange and had come up with <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s. And just in time.</p>
  <p>Several communities in the African continent were building computers, mostly from what computers they could find and spare parts. Not as fast as pre-cliff computers.However, they turned out to be fast enough to support the <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> so the communities that needed use them to implement the <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>.</p>
