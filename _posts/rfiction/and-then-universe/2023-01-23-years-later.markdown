<h1></h1>
 <p>We fought, but, mostly, we grew and got stronger. Much stronger, actually, based on a good <em>foundation</em>. We were coming back from the dangerous jump over the cliff, but we are different now.</p>

<h1>Above from Sratch</h1>
 <p>Actually, we had more than the knowledge in our heads. We had many of pre-cliff artifacts. We had robust languages.</p>

<h1>Energy&hellip;</h1>
 <p>We mostly lacked energy. We lacked industrial energy production and distribution. We had some energy stored in batteries and usable solar panels and wind towers.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;We have enough to let us restart from a little above scratch.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>The good news is that the Earth could take a deep breath because we stopped tossing carbon into our atmosphere. We had a scary, bumby fall over the cliff and our life support system got a break. Not too shabby.</p>
 <p>The thing is that you never know when or where that much needed innovation is going to show up. What used to be the US was like that for a while and it was prolific with innovations. But then patents came up the whole thing slowed down. For example, without pattents, we would have had the Bell and Gray telephones instead of one.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>Well, the energy innovation we all needed came from a community that had sprung up in the Australian continent. It was surprising because that land was still so hot as to be almost uninhabitable.</p>

<h1>&hellip; to Wireless</h1>
 <p>They figured out that freezing and thawing a molten sodium-sulphur solution creates a rechargeable battery, and a cheap, easy to make battery at that. They put out instructions and in no time people all over the world were messing with it, discovering all kinds of things, and letting others know. This in spite of the fact that there was no electric networks to speak of at the time.</p>
 <p>One thing led to another and in a few months somebody else came up with wireless energy transmission.</p>
 <p>Wireless. Energy. Transmission.</p>
 <p>The day side of the world, could light the dark side of the world. And no government sanctioned monopoly needed, thank you. It was all decentralized energy.</p>
 <p>This, by the way, was a good illustration of why the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system is so slow. Communities governed by the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system took a very long to get involved and allocate budgets and &hellip; you get the point. They took an eternity and by then all the key discoveries were done. Also by then they had lost some of the people that made these key discoveries in their new communities. They even refused to open themselves to networking with the rest us. Of course, more people left and some people warned that one day they would bring back war violence.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s</h1>
 <p>The bigger communities needed to something to keep track of exchanges. They came up with the <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>,<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> but it required computers, which, as it so happened, several communities in the African continent and the island of Cuba were building. These computers were cobbled from working or non-working devices, whatever they could find. Not as fast as pre-cliff computers, but fast enough to support <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s.</p>
 <p>Then came the salt battery and the wireless &ldquo;intergalactic.&rdquo; network.</p>
 <p>All this information was shared from community to community over the short-wave radio <em>network</em> that people had put together. This was enough for the <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span> to quickly become the world&rsquo;s exchange token, a fully transparent medium exchange.</p>
 <p>Smaller communities supported nearly worthless <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s because they knew the people minting them. Even though the chances of success were low, it was better to support these efforts than do nothing. Many never amounted to anything, but enough did. <span class="_quotespan">What the f&hellip; my <span class="_paradigm">rCOIN</span>s just grew feet!</span></p>
 <p>Thing were moving fast, but now the world moved even faster. And, except for the fast disappearing <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> communities, this time around, everybody co-owned everything.</p>
