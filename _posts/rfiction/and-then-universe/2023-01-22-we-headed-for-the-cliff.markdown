 <p>We headed for the cliff and it was very comfortable ride. Then we went over the cliff. Bumpy, but we survived.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>&ldquo;We headed for the cliff, and it was a very comfortable ride. Then we went over the cliff.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Luckily, when we hit the bottom, we were out of gas, so no explosion. Going down was bumpy, but we survived. Unfortunately, the anthropocene didn&rsquo;t quite make it in one piece and we had to start from scratch.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Well, not quite. We knew what we knew, and we could start <em>there</em>.&rdquo; As he said that, Zep pointed to his head. &ldquo;So, that is what we did. If we didn&rsquo;t lose our heads, we used them.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about you,&rdquo; Zep said as he got up, &rdquo;but tonight&rsquo;s storyteller is going to sleep.&rdquo;
 <p>&ldquo;We know what&rsquo;s next!&rdquo; the kids yelled. &ldquo;WE KNOW HOW IT ENDS!&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Without looking back, Zep responded, &ldquo;Good. Someobody else can finish it then.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>The group hung around a bit and bantered some more, but eventually most headed to sleep. Three of them stayed and finished their version of the story.</p>

<h1>Stories</h1>
 <p>I say <em>story</em> because it wasn&rsquo;t <em>recorded</em> history. Even though Zep had live lived through, he told different stories about it. But alwasy based on the same facts. He insisted on doing this way and showing all who listened that they must think for themselves and figure out which stories were true and which were not. The facts were the enchilada, the nutritional suff. The stories were the sauce. After listening to one of Zap&rsquo;s many stories, you had to figure out which was nourishing and which empty-calories.</p>
 
<h1>The Facts</h1>
 <p>We took apart our life support system. That is <em>the</em> fact.</p>
 <p>We made grand speeches and talked at length about climate crisis. Carbon credits and regulations were all gamed and nothing significant was done. We demanded and waited for powerful people to do what they were supposed to, but it all came to naught. We, in fact, had lots of options, but they got lost among the national politics stuff.</p>
 <p>Instead of lowering fossil fuel extraction, we kept using our atmosphere as an upside-down garbage can. Glogal termperatues went higher and the world got hotter. Climate &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; turned into &ldquo;disaster,&rdquo; but profits and most salaries went up, so nobody complained. &ldquo;The governments will clean up later.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Rather than take action, national governments kept up the soap opera and people became more confused, more polarized. Small nations didn&rsquo;t have the wherewithall to do much and rich countries were too focused on their wealth and didn&rsquo;t do what they could have.</p>

<h1>We Went Over</h1>
 <p>We headed for the cliff, at full speed, and we kept smiling and accelerating.</p>
 <p>Then we went over. And then the dystopian shitshow started to roll. Something was not quite the same, however. There was a slight change in the real life script.</p>
 <p>The expected violent gangs were there. Also, present were the <span calss="_paradigm">FIAT</span> communities, ruled by bosses and fighting over territory and people. This was not surprising.</p>

<h1>The Not-So-Dystopian Movie</h1>
 <p>But there were also a lot of small communities that shared everything they owned and with decentralized leadership.</p>
 <p>At first this didn&rsquo;t seem so surprising because they did not have that. Besides, they were so small they could easily co-manage.</p>
 <p>What was really surprising is that these communities had written foundations. Even more suprising, these foundation were pretty much copies of each other.</p>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>This foundation only had six words it: meaning, belonging, decentralization, transparency, and experimentation.
 <div class="_center">

   width="70%"
   alt="">
 </div>
 <p>I finally figured out that meaning and belonging were about people and then it all made sense. As a young womam told me, &ldquo;What makes each of us is that our actions are meaningful to all of us. Sometime it isn&rsquo;t, so we say something. The community has to work for all us, or else they&rsquo;d up and leave.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>After that, the rest of them became a lot more clear.</p>
 <p>Decentralization and transparency where the highest commitments of these communities. With these in hand, anybody could challenge any decision. &ldquo;Will that make us more or less decentralzed?&rdquo; Some groups had retreated to the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> way, to more and more centralization of power and need-to-know. But many more were getting more and more decentralized and transparent as they grew. And how they grew!</p>
 <p>As transparency grew, playfulness became more prevalent, and innovation blossomed.</p>
 <p>The hardest to understand was what the foundation calls &ldquo;experiementation.&rdquo; It was difficult, but it finally hit me. To me experiementation was people in labs did. But, really, everything we do, what we&rsquo;ve always done, is experiementation. And it fit the post-cliff world perfectly.</p>
 <p>We had confused people and machines and treated groups of people like machines. We did it and we went over the clif. And we were not going to make that mistake again.</p>

<h1>End of Act I</h1>
 <p>Actually, we had more than the knowledge in our heads. We had many of the artifacts, expecially language. We just lacked energy, or rather, energy distribution. We had some stored in batteries and there were still solar panels and wind towers. We had enough to let us restart from a little above scratch.</p>
 <p>Without energy distribution, we were forced to stop tossing carbon into our atmosphere and our planet got a break.</p>
