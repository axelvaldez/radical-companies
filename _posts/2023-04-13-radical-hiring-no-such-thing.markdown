 <p>I keep having this image of being able to show up at a company and start to work there without the interviews, the judgment, or any of the other barriers. The act of hiring is a very FIAT thing, it reeks of command and control.</p>
 <p>I suspect it has to do with the way I was hired at <em>XCOR Aerospace</em>. My friend and I called them up and asked if we could visit. They said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and we drove seven hours out into the Mojave desert. They could not show us around because they were testing their rocket plane. However, they asked us if we wanted to help roll the rocket plane out, which we did without hesitation. When we saw the rocket test fire, we were immediately sold on working there.</p>
 <p>We got a long talk from the CEO about the aerospace industry, how terrible it was, and how we should avoid the industry at all costs. It was the most unorthodox job hunt ever. In spite of it, we ended up happily working there. And that is the way that &ldquo;hiring&rdquo; should happen.</p>

<h1>(.*)</h1>
 <p>Expanding the co-owner base in the <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> world is equivalent to hiring in the <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> world.</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>BANNER</span> kick off the process of expanding the base of co-owners. They describe the proposed project and what it needs, including people skills,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Because <span class='_paradigm'>BANNER</span> are transparent, people outside the company can see if they match the skills that the company needs.</li>
   <li>They can also read about the company (decentralized Green Door), etc.</li>
   <li>Anybody can then choose to start to contribute and as they are recognized by other co-owners, you receive <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s.</li>
   <li>If what you do is not perceived as recognized contributions, you’d probably not belong in this company. Alternatively, you do belong, but you need a better job at letting others know what you’re doing and what you see as its significance.</li>
   <li>Once you state that you want to be a long-term part of this company, you will go through the <em>Explicit Relationship</em> and, if everything is OK with you, you are then part of the company.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Everything is up to you and not up to the company.</p>
 <p>Easy peasy!</p>
