<div style="display:none;">
 <p>You have a great idea which is neutral or good for the Earth-as-life-support. On the other hand, you don&rsquo;t have capital and your friends are busy with their own jobs.</p>
</div>

<h1>Good News, Bad News</h1>
 <p>On the positive side,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You have a great idea</li>
   <li>The idea is neutral or good for the Earth-as-life-support.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>On the other hand,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You don&rsquo;t have capital.</li>
   <li>Your friends are busy with their own jobs.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>The Foundation</h1>
 <p>Listen to the Forc&hellip; er&hellip; listen to the Foundation,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_background">
   <tr>
    <th style="text-align:right; ">people</th>
    <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>

 </div>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>Transparency: Talk about your idea to as many people as you can <em>anywhere in the wold</em>. This will help you mold your idea. If felt great when you first thought of it, but it now has to be shaped, so lean on your social circle to help you do it.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Decentralization: Talk to people but, they either won&rsquo;t get it or they will and be repelled by it. With all the talk about &ldquo;teal&rdquo; and the like, people will likely recognize co-management; they may even be enthusiastic about it. On the other hand, when you talk about co-ownership you may get a neutral stare or curiosity, but be ready for disgust or an ever-so-polite ridicule. They are not attacking you as much as they are trying to push out the thought you just put in their head.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Meaning & Belonging: if you identify people who are really interested in this, hold on to them. If they have skills that will help create your idea and you want them in your team, lucky you, go to the next step.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Experiment: Try variations on the theme at different times, then remember the ones that work.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

<h1>Borrowing, or Not</h1>
 <p>If you want to, borrow capital. &ldquo;Seed capital&rdquo; comes from friends, family, and fools. Friends and family know you and trust you; fools believe in you. They all want you to succeed.</p>
 <p>Seed capital is formalized as a legal Note that promises them, 1) their money back plus some up upside, or 2) shares of the new company. But you new company <em>won&rsquo;t have shares</em>, so Notes are not applicable.</p>
 <p>Instead treat borrowed capital like a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investment which includes an upside to be paid on top of the principal over a period of time. 120% over two years, or double after five, or &hellip; whatever you think is realistic and reasonable. Explain that this does not include any other powers. This won&rsquo;t be a surprise for the friends/family/fools crowd. It will most likely be a surprise, perhaps unacceptable, to traditional <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> investors. However, talk to them as well as a few are not traditionalists and may be inspired enough to give you capital-as-a-<span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span>-investment</p>
 <p>Once you have the capital it will go into whatever you have to buy and <em>the Predictable Recurring Income (PRI) fund</em>.</p>
 <p>Alternatively, you may forego borrowing any capital in which case there will not be PRI fund and co-owners must be willing and able to afford to wait for revenue.</p>

<h1>Hiring</h1>
 <p>You are not going to do any hiring, you are finding co-owners. You should repeat this, out loud, many times. Like a mantra.</p>
 <p>Since you are not hiring, you are not going to interview people. One way to not fall down the interview habit hole is to tell the person you are talking to that 1) you are looking for co-owners, 2) this is not an interview, and to 3) please, let me know when this starts to feel like one.</p>
 <p>What you are going to do is to explain that PRI fund to the co-owners who join you. Then you are goint to do a Trust Agreement with the first one.</p>

<h1>The PRI Fund</h1>
 <p>This is what PRI does,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Until revenue starts to come in, the PRI Fund pays co-owners.</li>
   <li>Well, actually, it is not the revenue, but the earned dividends that pays the PRI fund. Earned dividens is what is left of the review after paying off all expenses, etc.</li>
   <li>Even after earned dividends start to materialize, the PRI Fund may supplement a co-onwers&rsquo;s take home.</li>
   <li>Eventually, the earned dividends a co-owner gets starts to pay off co-owner&rsquo;s debt to the PRI fund. How much of it goes into paying PRT fund depenps on what you, the co-owners, have agreed to.</li>
   <li>Finally, after the debt is all paid up, co-owners take earned dividends home, in addition to their home pay.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>This is how <span class="_quotespan">take home</span> is determined,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Each co-owner declares what she needs to take home.</li>
   <li>If this figure is would, say, dry the PRI fund too quickly, co-owners have to decide what to do.</li>
   <li>In the happy path, the declared figure is agreed to.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>This is the important, and probably most contentious, thing: a withdrawal from the PRI fund is <em>a personal debt</em> that a co-owner is responsible for. Other policies are plausible, but this seems to be the most basic and fair. Co-owners are not exchanging their time for just a salary as is the case in <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> land. The people who draw from the PRI fund are the co-owners and each is responsible for what they borrow from the fund.</p>
 <p>As co-owners, you may decide put limits on time (<span class="_quotespan">We have agreed to do this for six months&hellip;</span>) or amount (<span class="_quotespan">We have agreed to do this for as long as the $500,000 in the PRI fund lasts</span>).</p>
 <p>Alternatively, co-owners may decide to take on the debt as a group. Or&hellip; The point is that it is up to you, the co-owners.</p>

<h1>The <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> Mobile App</h1>
 <p>Co-owners use the <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> mobile app to recognize other co-owners&rsquo; contributions. The <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> app also converts these contributions into <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s at the end of the cycle (<em>e.g.</em>, monthly).</p>
 <p>Co-owners can recognize anything as a contributions. These can range from a tangible benefit to the company (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; found us a place to store return merchandize for free.</span>) to something more intangible (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; took the time to talk to him and to help him get his mental health taken care of.</span> or even <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; I could not help but smile when he did that.</span>)</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s can factor anything through them. For example, if I have 10% of the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s distributed and you have 20%, you get twice as much as I do of whatever is being filtered through the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s this time (<em>e.g.</em>, earned dividends on revenue).</p>

<h1>Expressed Alignment</h1>
 <p>Since you have co-owners, and no boss, you still to somehow align on what needs to get done, etc., and that is what the Expressed Alignment tool is about,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/en-alignment.svg"
   width="70%"
   alt="">
 </div>
 <p>Co-owners should get together as soon as possible, or sooner, to figure out answers to the questions in the Expressed Alignment below. This is extremely key.</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_background">
   <tr>
    <th>Impact<br><span class="_alignquestions">what for?</span></th>
    <td>What impact they want to make (<em>i.e.</em>, be remembered by). For example, <span class="_quotespan">Improve people&rsquo;s health.</span></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Purpose<br><span class="_alignquestions">why?</span></th>
    <td>Why are we doing this for? For example, <span class="_quotespan">Easy to get, healthy foods.</span></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Mission<br><span class="_alignquestions">what?<br>when?<br>how?</span></th>
    <td>What are doing, when, and How? For example, <span class="_quotespan">We already have a partner farm that will harvest by end the of April. We mean to sign up the first 100 customers by the end of March.</span></td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </div>
 <p>These not cast in stone, but have different rates of change,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The <b>Mission</b> will change as often as necessary. If there is more than one team, each team has its own mission, but it must align with the <b>Impact</b> and <b>Purpose</b> of the whole company.</li>
   <li>The <b>Purpose</b> will change less often, but it could change as new co-onwers join.</li>
   <li>The <b>Impact</b> should not change at all, at least not without a deep discussion. This may happen, but it is a major thing, equivalent to creating a new company.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Trust Agreement</h1>
 <p>Do a Trust Agreement with the first co-owner in the team. This is a guide to an exploration among would-be co-owners to make sure that they are or can get aligned and they want to work with each other. Even if this is a relative or somebody you know very well, don&rsquo;t skip doing the Trust Agreement. Maybe it turns out to be perfectly boring or you may discover surprises along the way.</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_background">
   <tr>
    <th>Mindset</th>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>How do you show up? Who are you?</li>
      <li>Why do you need others?</li>
      <li>What do you feel we need to agree on?</li>
      <li>What are your red lines?</li>
      <li>Anything else?</li>

      <li>What we really need to know is what does each of the above look like?</li>
      <li>How would we know if you are angry, feel shut up, or excited?</li>
      <li>Anything else?</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Also known as vulnerabilty.</p>

      <li>Do you speak up? How?</li>
      <li>Do you need to be given persmission to speak? <span class="_quotespan">You didn&rsquo;t ask me!</span></li>
      <li>Anything else?</li>
     </ul>
    </td>
   </tr>

      <li>What gives you joy?</li>
      <li>How can we help you collaborate with us?</li>
      <li>What stops you on your tracks?</li>
      <li>How can we avoid doing that?</li>
      <li>How do we know when you are collaborating? How do you show up?</li>
      <li>What impact you have to have?</li>
     </ul>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Alignment</th>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>Please, take a look at our Alignment table, particularly its <b>Impact</b> and <b>Purpose</b>.</li>
      <li>What thoughts does this bring up?</li>
      <li>Does it work for you?</li>
      <li>Does anything need to change or be clarified for you?</li>
     </ul>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Foundation</th>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>Please take a look at the Foundation.</li>
      <li>What thoughts does this bring up?</li>
     </ul>
    </td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </div>
 <p>Our recomendation is that you allot one hour each to</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Mindset</b> and <b>About&hellip;</b></li>
   <li><b>Transparency</b> and <b>Collaboration</b>,</li>
   <li><b>Alignment</b> and <b>Foundation</b>.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>We have spend many more that three hours on these. Doing it will get you a deep trust with other co-owners that <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses don&rsquo;t ever get near.</p>
 <p>Finally, for subsequent co-owner candidates, other co-owners can go through the <em>Trust Agreement</em> with them. Remember, you are not the boss.</p>
