 <p>I have been wondering what has made me feel this way. Thinking back, I remember that I took the first step by realizing that my life was empty. I needed to connect with myself.</p>

 <p>I love. My self-love has grown. I love my smile.</p>
 <p>The feeling came to me as a loud snap. I saw my own, genuine smile. I must have seen it before, but I had not loved it before. In the past I had to force myself to smile, it was uncomfortable. I felt that smiling made me vulnerable; it'd be better not to smile and protect myself. But now I smile when I feel like smiling, take a selfie, or a video, or just when I see my reflection in the mirror and there is that genuine smile shining right back. Even, no, particulary when I didn&rsquo;t know that I am smiling, I love seeing it. Sometime I worry that I this is some form of narcissism. When I am telling others about <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies and their philosophy they can tell my enthusiam and my passion about them by the way my eyes shine. This is one of the many things that I am playing with to become more me.</p>
 <p>I have been wondering what has made me feel this way. Thinking back, I remember that I took the first step by realizing that my life was empty. I needed to connect with myself.</p>
 <p>I know now that the trigger was <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Companies. At first I believed that keeping control was my thing. But then I understood that seeing people as people was my calling, not seeing them as resources. People, not robots. That simple fact made a huge difference to me. People can free their potential at the same time they grow, and align with others to create something big, bigger than they could create for themselve.</p>
 <p>Something changed in me and I now think that seeing a company as a group of aligned people. Everything fits and I can see it.</p>
 <p>I believe it was that shift that woke me up, that make feel that I could be just because I could. The feeling of emptiness that that realization let out was scary. I was surviving, not living. That is why I felt so bad in a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> company, not being able to be part, not mattering. There is no such thing as a private live and work life. The way things are, a big part of you is left in the parking lot. <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Companies taught to be a whole person anywhere and howevr I go.</p>
 <p>I bought me flowers. For the first time. I had never clebrated myself before, I had never thanked me, but I finally felt I must. Hooray for my past self, because thanks to her I have a genuine smile. Thanks for her I can see who I am versus what <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses want me to be.</p>
 <p>There are still lots of scary stuff head, but I am staying on the path and eating mandarins. I can see that the time will come when I will see these fears behind me. I can see the time when I will be a better version of me.</p>
 <p>Thanks to life and all that got me here.</p>
