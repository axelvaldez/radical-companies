 <p>I have been wondering what has made me feel this way. Thinking back, I remember that I took the first step by realizing that my life was empty. I needed to connect with myself.</p>

<h1>Love</h1>
 <p>I love. My self-love has grown. I love my smile.</p>
 <p>The feeling came to me as a loud snap. I saw my own, genuine smile. I must have seen it before, but I had not loved it before. In the past I had to force myself to smile, it was uncomfortable. I felt that smiling made me vulnerable; it'd be better not to smile and protect myself. But now I smile when I feel like smiling, take a selfie, or a video, or just when I see my reflection in the mirror and there is that genuine smile shining right back. Even, no, particularly when I don&rsquo;t know that I am smiling, I love seeing it. Sometimes I worry that I this is some form of narcissism, but &hellip; nah!.</p>
 <p>When I am telling others about <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies and their philosophy they can tell my enthusiamm and my passion about them by the way my eyes shine. This is one of the many things that I am trying on to become more me.</p>
 <p>I have been wondering what has made me feel this way. Thinking back, I remember that I took the first step by realizing that my life felt empty and I needed to connect with myself.</p>

<h1>The Trigger</h1>
 <p>I know now that the trigger was <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> Companies. At first I believed that keeping control was my thing. But then I understood that seeing people as people was my calling, not seeing them as resources. People, not robots. That simple fact made a huge difference to me. People can free their potential at the same time they grow, and align with others to create something big, bigger than they could create by themselves.</p>
 <p>Something changed in me and I now believe that seeing a company as a group of aligned people was the key. Everything fits. I can see everything falling into place. That woke me up and made feel all that I could be just because I could.</p>
 <p>To my surprise, a feeling of emptiness came up and it was scary. I was surviving, not living. That is why I felt so bad in a <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> company, not being able to be part of anything, not mattering except as a smart robot.</p>

<h1>Born Out of Desperation</h1>
 <p>There is no such thing as a private live and work life. That is a myth born out of desperation. Go in the office, but leave most of you out in the parking lot. <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> Companies taught me to be a whole person anywhere, anytime, and however I go.</p>

<h1>Celebrate!</h1>
 <p>I bought me flowers. For the first time. I had never celebrated myself before, I had never thanked me, but I finally felt I must. Hooray for my past self, because thanks to her I have a genuine smile. Thanks to her I can see who I am versus what <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses want me to be.</p>

<h1>&hellip; and Smile</h1>
 <p>There are still lots of scary stuff ahead, but I am staying on the path and eating mandarins.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> I can see that the time will come when I will see these fears behind me. I can see the time when I will be a better version of me.</p>
 <p>Thanks to life and all that got me here.</p>
