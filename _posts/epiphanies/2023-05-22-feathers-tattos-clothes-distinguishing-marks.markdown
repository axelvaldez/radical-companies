 <p>Feathers, tattoos, or extravagant clothes are ways of calling attention to ourselves They are <em>distinguishing</em> marks. &ldquo;Look at me. Pay attention to me. <em>I have something to say about survival</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Communications</h1>
 <p>People want to be heard. They feel they have something important to say that would impact their wellbeing (selfish), and they even have an intuition that it impacts the wellbeing of the community (selfless). <span class="_quotespan">I (<em>me!</em>) want to make a contribution.</span></p>
 <p>It is not cognitive&mdash; it&rsquo;s an emotial impulse. And it is fundamental to all communications,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Assume that people want to say something important, even if doesn&rsquo;t come out that way at first.</li>
   <li>Take into account that people may not have the skills to express it &ldquo;correctly.&rdquo;</li>
   <li>Help them by asking questions.</li>
   <li>Don&rsquo;t look fpr fault and don&rsquo;t look to ridicule. Help them make it intelligible.</li>
   <li>You are not their father, or their brother, but you are a member of their community.</li>
   <li>Lead with love.</li>
  </ul>
