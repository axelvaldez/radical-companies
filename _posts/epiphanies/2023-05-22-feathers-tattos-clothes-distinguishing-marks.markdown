 <p>Feathers, tattoos, or extravagant clothes are ways of calling attention to ourselves. They are <em>distinguishing</em> marks. &ldquo;Pay attention to me. I can contribute to <em>our survival</em>.&rdquo;</p>
 
<h1>Communications</h1>
 <p>People want to be heard. They feel they have something important to say that would impact their wellbeing (selfish) and maybe the wellbeing of the community (selfless). <span class="_quotespan">I (<span class="_me">me!</span>) have a contribution to make!</span></p>
 <p>It is not cognitive&mdash; it&rsquo;s an emotional impulse. And I have a hunch that it is fundamental to all communications,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Assume that people want to say something important, even if doesn&rsquo;t come out that way at first.</li>
   <li>Take into account that people may not have the skills to make it intelligible. But they can learn.</li>
   <li>Help them by asking questions.</li>
   <li>Don&rsquo;t look for fault and don&rsquo;t look to ridicule. Help them learn to say it in a way their community can understand.</li>
   <li>You are not their mother, or their sibling, but you are a member of their community.</li>
   <li>Lead with love.</li>
  </ul>
