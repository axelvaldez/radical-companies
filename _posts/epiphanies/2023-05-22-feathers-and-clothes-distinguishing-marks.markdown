 <p>Feathers, tatoos, or extravagant clothes are ways of calling attention to ourselves. They are <em>distinguishing</em> marks. &ldquo;Look at me. Pay attention to me. I am important to your survival.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Communications</h1>
 <p>People want to be heard. They feel they have something important to say that would impact their wellbeing (selfish). They have an intuition that it also has to do with the wellbeing of the community (selfless).</p>
 <p>It is not congnitive, but an emotial impulse. This is fundamental to all communications,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Assume that people want to say something important to them.</li>
   <li>Take into account that people may not have the skills to express it.</li>
   <li>Help with questions.</li>
   <li>Don&rsquo;t look faults and don&rsquo;t ridicule&mdash;that is now the ability to communicate has been stunted.</li>
   <li>You are not their father, or their brother. But you are a member of their community.</li>
   <li>Lead with love.</li>
  </ul>
