<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Krisos, created by ex-K2K consultants, is in the business of transforming <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business into co-managed, co-owned companies (<em>i.e.</em>, close to the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model). The big difference is that whereas K2K works with current <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> owners, Krisos buys them out. THeir hypothesis is that without the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> owners, they can be more effective in the transformation to co-management.</p>
 </p>Where I am unclear about is their approach to co-owneship. In particular, their &ldquo;profit sharing&rdquo; plans, so I am going to share an opportunity for them: move from K2K&rsquo; model of 70% for <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> owners and 30% for co-owner/employees split of the profits (<em>i.e</em>, really, earned dividend) to a 0/100 scheme.</p>

 </div>
 <p>They can do this at different speeds, but it would put them in a different class altogether.</p>
 <p>And 100/0 is what we need more of. Our own hypothesis is that it will lead to companies that go beyond the co-management model and systematically promote a solid <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL FOUNDATION</span>,</p>
