 <p>At one point I was really excited around ESOP, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. And then I reserached it and I wasn&rsquo;t so excited anymore.</p>
 <p>The ESOP law was inspired by the book Capitalist Manifest, by Louis Kelso and Mortimer Adler. Adler was he writer, but the idea came from Kelso. As a recent post by Thomas Lewin reminds us, <span class='_quotespan'>If you contribute to the success of an enterprise, you share in the reward,</span></p>
  <ul>
   <li>Shared #Success: ESOPs embody the philosophy that those who contribute to success should also share in the rewards. This is a game-changer in driving employee performance and satisfaction.</li>
   <li>Retention Revolution: Say goodbye to the revolving door of talent. With ESOPs, your top performers have a vested interest in your company's success and are more likely to stick around.</li>
   <li>Smooth Succession: ESOPs keep the power within the organization, ensuring a seamless transition and uninterrupted growth.</li>
   <li>Empowered Culture: Employees aren't just workers, they're owners. This fosters a culture of mutual respect, shared responsibility, and collective triumph.</li>
   <li>Win-Win Wealth: ESOPs are beneficial not just for the employees, but also for the company, with various tax advantages in play</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Levin claims that, <span class='_quotespan'>This is a game-changer in driving employee performance and satisfaction.</span> And that is pretty much the way I felt until I discovered how many loopholes have crept in the law over the years. Today is is simply a windfall for the origianl owner.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> The employee-owners continue to be employees and have no say in the management of the business which continues to be ruled by a Board and a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> hierarchy.</p>
