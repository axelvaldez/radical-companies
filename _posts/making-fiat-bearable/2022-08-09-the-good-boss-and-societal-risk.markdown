 <p>A good boss is someone who protects you from the hierarchy, or empowers you with decision-making, or gets you anything you want, or just leaves you alone. That is not bad, but it is fragile and temporary.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>A good boss protects you from the hierarchy, empowers you with some decision-making, or gets you anything you want, or just leaves you alone. That may be not bad, but it is always fragile and temporary.</p>
 <p>This struck home to me as I was listening to a book about Bell Labs. The researchers at Bell Labs were allowed a huge degree of autonomy and they could choose what they wanted to work on. It did not have to have an immediately obvious practical use. It was basic research, discovering fundamental things about how chemistry and physics worked.</p>
 
<h1>Claude Shannon</h1>
 <p>The poster child for this was Claude Shannon who was given even wider latitude than usual given his professors recommendations to Ma Bell. They had  an intuition that he would do great things if left to his own devices. So the Labs went out of its way to let Shannon pick his work.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he would write a text on Information Theory that would define the ‚Äúbit‚Äù and other concepts about how information could be measured and thought about. It was groundbreaking and ripples of his achievement are still being strongly felt to this day.</p>
 <p>Later, Shannon would work on automated chess machines and other electronic inventions. The works was important, too,to some degree, but he never again produced anything like Information Theory.</p>
 <p>Imagine now for a moment that he had been directed to tackle the automated chess games and other electronic machines <em>before</em> he had written about Information Theory. Or he might have been encouraged to stay the course with his inventions. Or perhaps he would have been encouraged to leave and take up an academic position.</p>
 
 <h1>Better than Bell Labs</h1>
 <p>Bell Labs was hands off and a good place for researchers, so long as researchers picked things that had some plausible impact on the Bell Phone <em>business</em>. Even Shockley with his semiconductor research was trying to make an amplifier to <em>replace vacuum tubes</em>.</p>
 <p>What would be better than one Bell Labs would be a community of them. I see some value is focusing research, certainly for companies. But there would be more value <em>to society</em> if there were a <em>community of labs</em> and people could follow their curiosity from one to the other. <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s</a><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> make sure that whatever contributions a researcher made in one lab would not be lost and would carry out to the next.</p>

<h1>Lucky Us</h1>
 <p>I wasn't expecting it, but listening to the book made me aware of how extremely lucky Bell Labs and the rest of society had gotten when Shannon decided to tackle Information Theory <em>first</em>. And therein lies the flaw of management as a temporary, and fragile, guarantor of autonomy. It was not systemic.</p>
 <p>If Bell Labs had been committed to decentralization and transparency and to creating meaning and belonging, then Shannon would have had the autonomy he needed <em>systemic level</em>. He could have tackled subjects in whatever order he pleased, whether it'd be Information Theory first or last or in the middle. It would not be up to the largesse of his <em>good boss</em> and the <em>hierarchy</em> he was beholden to.</p>

<h1>Radically Healthier</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model ensures the gains of invention, discovery, and innovation for society. Invention under a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> framework is very high risk. It goes against the norm and it leaves us in a situation where a manager plays roulette with his future within the hierarchy. He might get lucky or there may be some thrill around the risk, but does he really want to live at the edge chance? Do we want society&rsquo;s achievements to be won that way?</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model provides a healthier path toward discovery and achievement, one without the threat of professional death constantly hanging overhead.</p>
