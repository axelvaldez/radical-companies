<h1>ESOPs</h1>
 <p>At one point I was really excited around ESOP, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. And then I reserached it and I wasn&rsquo;t so excited anymore.</p>
 <p>The ESOP law was inspired by the book Capitalist Manifest, by Louis Kelso and Mortimer Adler. Adler was he writer, but the idea came from Kelso. As a recent post by Thomas Lewin put is, <span class='_quotespan'>If you contribute to the success of an enterprise, you share in the reward,</span></p>
  <ul>
   <li>Shared Success: ESOPs embody the philosophy that those who contribute to success should also share in the rewards. This is a game-changer in driving employee performance and satisfaction.</li>
   <li>Retention Revolution: Say goodbye to the revolving door of talent. With ESOPs, your top performers have a vested interest in your company's success and are more likely to stick around.</li>
   <li>Smooth Succession: ESOPs keep the power within the organization, ensuring a seamless transition and uninterrupted growth.</li>
   <li>Empowered Culture: Employees aren't just workers, they're owners. This fosters a culture of mutual respect, shared responsibility, and collective triumph.</li>
   <li>Win-Win Wealth: ESOPs are beneficial not just for the employees, but also for the company, with various tax advantages in play.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Levin claims that, <span class='_quotespan'>This is a game-changer in driving employee performance and satisfaction.</span> And that is pretty much the way I felt until I discovered how many loopholes have crept in the law over the years. Today is is simply a windfall for the origianl owner.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> The employee-owners continue to be employees and have no say in the management of the business which continues to be ruled by a Board and a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> hierarchy.</p>
 <p>Unfortuntely, Kelso&rsquo;s ESOPs stayed within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, making it a little bit more bearable for <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> owners.</p>

<h1>Non-Fiat</h1>
 <p>The good news is that a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system provides these benetifs for every co-owner,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Shared Success: This would be more like community success, where the community could part of company or an esembles of companies.</li>
   <li>Retention Revolution: It is not so much retention-of-employees-to-make-weath-for-me, but that people would want stay with the community that they are part off. On the other hand, it they need to move on, they can and they take the part of the part of the company they helped create.</li>
   <li>Smooth Succession: This doesn&rsquo;t mean anything in a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> environment. On the other hand, if we interpret it as the &ldquo;smooth succession&rdquo; of the company itself, then this makes more sense. Note that this is not the succession of a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> wealth-making-for-the-owners business. It means that the company doesn&rsquo;t fall apart because of one departure.</li>
   <li>Empowered Culture: The ESOP is neither empowered nor a culture. Non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> companies are based on decentralization, co-management and co-ownership, and as such they are a culture, empowerered by every co-owner in the team.</li>
   <li>Win-Win Wealth: ESOPs are like co-ops in that they divide (what the Board decides are) dividends equally among all employees. That&rsquo;s not ideal. A mere division cannot supplant the co-owners participation in deciding who deserves what. Non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> companies take every co-owner into consideration through the <em><span class='_paradigm'>RADs!</span> mobile app.</em></li>
  </ul>
