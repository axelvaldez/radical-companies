 <p>There's nothing decentralized or autonomous about DAOs. That's not a criticism, it's simply an observation. They don't address the main societal issue today which is an overuse of force, and it's child, dominance.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">The DAO Story</h1>
 <p>In spite of their name, there's nothing decentralized or autonomous about DAOs. I don't mean that as a criticism, but simply as an observation. As a criticism I would point out that the DAO technology is an <em>automated investment</em> platform meant to make creating money-first organizations more efficient. As such, it is a technology that would do nothing but expand <span style="font-size:smaller; ">Fiat</span> investment options.</p>
 <p>Financial investment has progressed from royalty, to wealthy patrons, to banks, to VCs: DAO is simply the next step in that progression. But the technology promises to do nothing towards taking ourselves and the world we live in. It is still grounded on the same principles of force and fear, "I have the capital, I am the boss." What it brings into the picture is a frictionless way for what VCs call <em>limited partners</em> (LP): more of them can enter at any capital amount. Great, more capitalists which should give way to more entrepreneurs. Not bad if you want to see the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system continue on its path to more fear, domination, force, and a bigger wealth gap with fewer and fewer at a higher, and higher top. The DAO technology as configured now will make that worse.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, all the creativity that has gone into creating the DAO technology could also be used to create alternatives to the <span style="font-size:smaller; ">Fiat</span> regime.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">DAOs Are Not Decentralized</h1>
 <p>DAOs<sup id="bm01"><a href="#en01">1</a></sup> are more or less centralized, depending on its governance model, but they are not decentralized. In fact, here's no technology to decentralize them. More LPs (Limited Partners to a Venture Capital fund) and less friction does not equal decentralization. Sure, LPs have the choice of not joining the DAO or, depending on the governance model, bailing out, but that’s not a solution to our big problem.<p>
 <p>Our big problem is the &ldquo;because I say so&rdquo;, <span style="font-size:smaller; ">Fiat</span> ways of doing things. We need to move to a truly decentralized alternative to our current system based on force and fear.<p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">DAOs Are Not Autonomous</h1>
 <p>DAOs are not autonomous just because &ldquo;they are run by code, not by people.&rdquo; In fact, they are governed by committees of people. Even if those could be eliminated, their <em>code</em> is created by people.</p>
 <p>In any case, autonomy is the domain of people. We need autonomous collaboration among people, and people collaborate via conversations. Today&rsquo;s DAOs are basically an <em>automated investment</em> platform, but, instead, we need a conversation platform supported by all the cool Web3 technology and technology that does not yet exist.<sup id="bm02"><a href="#en02">2</a></sup></p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">What Do DAOs Have to Do with Fear?</h1>
 <p>I have been bringing up &ldquo;violence,&rdquo; &ldquo;force,&rdquo; and &ldquo;fear,&rdquo; without any explanation at all. I&rsquo;d like to do that now. Fear is so prevalent in our present world that it mostly goes unnoticed. At least, it goes unnoticed by our cognitive system, by the neocortex; the rest of our body is affected by it and often not in a good, healthy way.</p>
 <p>You work for your boss (<em>i.e.</em>, &ldquo;<em>report</em>&rdquo; is the modern euphemism). The work you do goes to meet his goals, which were imposed on him by his own boss. If something goes wrong, it is your fault; you may even feel bad that he is going to look bad to his boss. If it goes really bad, you may end up being fired from your job and there goes your livelihood. Even if you are not worried about finding another job, very few people enjoy the interview process where you have to convince people on the other side of the table that you are going to definitely meet their goals. This is just one narrative.<p>
 <p>Your goals are handed down to you, perhaps by well-meaning, polite people, but they are nevertheless handed down to you. You may make a few adjustments to a goal, but, generally, there is no discussion as to what it is for, why it has to be done, or when and how to get it done. You don’t even think of asking these questions “at work.” You may feel it is not your place, or your boss is going to get upset if you ask too many questions, and who are you to ask? Behind it all fear modulates what you say, when you say it, to whom. Fear that you’ll get penalized, even fired. Fear of upsetting your boss. Fear that your boss, and many of your peers, will think badly of you.</p>
 <p>I see it as there being two types of fears: the healthy one that comes from inside you and keeps you alive and away from the tiger’s jaws. Call that <em>good-fear</em>. Then there is the fear that comes from outside of you, from people who can hurt you. Call that <em>bad-fear</em>. We embrace the bad-fear as if it were good-fear and we don’t say what we see as dangerous; we don’t ask clarifying questions; we don’t express what we feel. That is unhealthy fear because even though our cognitive brain doesn’t notice, our bodies do. They notice and react to bad-fear in many, mostly unhealthy, chronic ways.</p>
 <p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;But that's the way it is. You have to learn to restrain yourself and be polite about what you say and how you say. Otherwise, we will end up like animals, hurting each other.&rdquo; That reasoning is fear, too. Think of it this way: as a species, we are pretty successful. Do you think we got here by behaving like animals towards each other? In fact, social animals, like us, collaborate, not compete, and that's what&rsquo;s made them successful as a species. Perhaps we should behave more like the social animals we are.</p>
 <p>Force, and the fear it engenders, is what&rsquo;s holding us back, it hurts us, and will eventually kill more of us.</p>
