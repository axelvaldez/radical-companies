 <p>Free lunches and massages are ineffective, terrible. They make the current business paradigm more palatable for a little bit while it continues unabated.</p>

 <p>Free lunches and massages are ineffective, terrible tweaks trying to make the FIAT system more palatable.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>The article really is a shill post on how Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;core business&rdquo; because it &ldquo;has shown itself to be resilient.&rdquo; But it does illustrate that free lunches and other frills are business hostile. They are the equivalent of twiddling your thumbs and the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system continues unabated.</p>
 <p>Competition and dominance.</p>
 <p>Winners and losers.</p>
 <p>Lazy, greedy, and cowardly.</p>
 <p>All thanks to the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system. The invisible system that puts financial success above all else.</p>
