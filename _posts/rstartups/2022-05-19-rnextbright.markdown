<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p><em>rNextBright</em> is a code school, a freedom indoctrination hall. It’s getting hooked on dignity.</p>
 <p>As sports farms are incubators for sports players, <em>rNextBright</em> is an incubator for people to learn their craft working alongside mentors.</p>

<h1>Operational Goals</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Make it free or very inexpensive for students.</li>
  <li>Pay students a stipend to cover living expenses.</li>
  <li>Make it very attractive to employers.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Give preference to co-managed businesses and RADICAL companies.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Origin Story</h1>
 <p>The inspiration comes straight from our experience of the Nearsoft Academy project and from watching Beetroot, a Ukrainian company, at work. People enter the program with little programming experience, not used to working in a team, and poor communication skills. They come out of it with developed skills in all those areas.</p>

<h1>How It Works</h1>
 <p>Graduates can choose to join a legacy company, a self-managed company, or a <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> company (<em>e.g.</em>, a rHintersoft  instance).</p>

<h1>Mentoring</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Like StackOverflow, but <em>live</em></li>
  <li>Mentors Pair with Mentees</li>
  <li>Mentors get <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Programs for Employers</h1>
 <p>Integrate employers into the program and create opportunities for them to participate as early as possible in the process. They are the beneficiaries of making this happen.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Employers: employer developers mentoring the less experienced.</li>
  <li>Traditional vs NextBright Sourcing – Hire graduates for a a percentage of salary vs hire them for less by prepaying for <code>N</code> hires. Requires an in-depth Kickoff.</li>
  <li>Either of above, but with discounts/credits for participating in the training (mentorship).</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Employer Opportunities</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Participate as instructors.</li>
  <li>Participate as guest lecturers.</li>
  <li>Participate as Mentors.</li>
  <li>Co-learning Buddies (<em>i.e., </em>not full-mentors, but will show/Pair on a particular technique).</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Services</h1>
 <p>Participation requirements.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Training/consulting to make themselves ready for the new recruits.</li>
  <li>How to be a mentor and not suck at it.</li>
  <li>Formalizing a training regime for their own folks (to raise the software&rsquo;s dev community skill level, in general).</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Location</h1>
 <p>Virtual, with regular IRL socializing opportunities. The latter can be done in partnership with co-working spaces, at a client’s premise, etc.</p>

<h1>Revenue, Scholarships</h1>
 <p>Potential paying Clients,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>US and Mexican software product companies</li>
  <li>US and Mexican IT shops (?)</li>
  <li>US-centric software development services, like Nearsoft, Tiempo, etc.</li>
  <li>Mexican-centric software services</li>
 </ul>
 <p>In other words, anybody who needs to hire developers but, preferably, software product companies or software development shops that work with those companies (<em>e.g.</em>, Nearsoft).</p>

<h1>Other Funding for Students</h1>
 <p>There are several models in the wild,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Totally based on donations.</li>
  <li>No money up front, but some % of salary once a student starts to work in the area (most popular).</li>
  <li>Time-boxed Investments (RADICAL).</li>
  <li>Employer Scholarships can be used to defray program costs for needy students.</li>
  <li>A portion of the fee paid by employers is used to reimburse graduates for some or all of the fees they paid.</li>
