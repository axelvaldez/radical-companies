<div style="display: none; ">
 <p>Politics is local, it starts at the grassroots. BuddyNeighbor build communities of neighbors who know each other, can talk to each other, and can act together.</p>
</div>

<h1>Origin Story</h1>
 <p>On Mon Oct 1, 2018, my good friend Jose Contreras sent me a text out of the blue. This got the whole thing started.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>Since then we have learned quite a bit and when I looked at this post, it struck me that it was somewhat dated. Here I try to revise a bit.</p>

<h1>Membership</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>People must first become members of <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> to participate (<em>i.e.</em>, there could be a trial).</li>
  <li>People are our only customers.</li>
  <li>Members co-own everything about <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span>.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Scenarios</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> platform helps put <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>s physically in front of each other. This way they can bond by <em>doing something for each other</em>. A <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> needs something, the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> takes care of it, they get to know each other a little better, and they both get to feel good about themselves.</p>
 <div class="_center">

    <th>Happy Path Example</th>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> goes to Safeway at 11 pm.</li>
      <li>A few minutes before, a <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> put in a request for a, <span class="_quotespan">A gallon of 2% milk, Organic Valley preferred, by midnight. Otherwise, bring me a half gallon of whatever they have. If it&rsquo;s going to take you more than one hour, ignore this, please (I need to go to sleepâ€”got early meetings tomorrow).</span></li>
      <li>When the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> gets to Safeway, the system alerts her of this request. <span class="_quotespan">This will take you an extra five to ten minutes and approximate five blocks out of your route.</span></li>
      <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span>  reviews the request and gets to see the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>s&rsquo; <span class="_quotespan">vitals&rdquo; (<em>e.g.</em>, &ldquo;single male, currently alone, thinks stabbing dolls is LOL</span> or <span class="_quotespan">mom of three, the whole family is home with her</span><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>). This is a kind of creep factor that this <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> needs to know before she can safely accept a request.</li>
      <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span>  accepts the request.</li>
      <li>The system summarizes, <span class="_quotespan">You are promising to deliver one gallon of Organic Valley 2% milk to Jose at&hellip;</span></li>
      <li>So far, the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> doesn&rsquo;t know anything.</li>
      <li>Once she accepts the request, the system will let the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> know that, <span class="_quotespan">Your request for Organic Valley 2% milk has been accepted. We&rsquo;ll charge $2.70 to your account. Do you still want it?</span></li>
      <li>Jose, the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>, accepts.</li>
      <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> gets her stuff, including Jose&rsquo;s milk, stands in line, and pays for the goods.</li>
      <li>As the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> leaves Safeway,<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> the system alerts the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> that, <span class="_quotespan">Your 2% Organic Valley milk is on its way and will get to you in about 10 minutes.</span></li>
      <li>As the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> gets close to the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>&rsquo;s home, <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> alerts the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> that, <span class="_quotespan">Your <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span>, her name and avatar, is about to get to your home with your Organic Valley 2% milk.</span></li>
      <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> parks, but her boyfriend walks to Jose&rsquo;s front door.</li>
      <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> communicates with Margot through the app, <span class="_quotespan">Hey, there&rsquo;s a guy at my door, is he with you?</span></li>
      <li>Margot realizes his concern and says, <span class="_quotespan">Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ll come up, too. Sorry about that.</span></li>
      <li>She comes up and Jose opens the door and they talk. Margot points to their place down the street, Jose tells them about getting the kids fed in the morning, Margot tells him about a Neighborhood event scheduled for the weekend, they talk about the Farmer Markets in the area, &hellip;</li>
      <li>Jose lets us know accepts the delivery and maybe adds a note to it, <span class="_quotespan">Got the milk and got to meet a very nice <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> named Margot. I got to meet her boyfriend, too. They make a nice couple.</span></li>
     </ul>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Not-so-Happy Path Example</th>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> never shows up and Jose tells us that he is closing his request because, <span class="_quotespan">the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> never got here.</span></li>
      <li>Then we&rsquo;ll tell the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> something like, <span class="_quotespan">Sorry. We won&rsquo;t be charging anything to your account. We are donating <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s to the <span class='_paradigm'><span class='_paradigm'>BANNER</span> to build a Neighborhood gym. In any case, if you&rsquo;d like, we can let you know what Margot has to say about breaking her promise. Please, let us know if you&rsquo;re interested.</span></li>
      <li>We&rsquo;ll ask the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span>, <span class="_quotespan">What happened, you broke your promise to Jose!</span></li>
      <li>Her response might be, <span class="_quotespan">I had to go straight home right away because my <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> found my dog in her backyard. I was all flustered and forgot to let Jose know. Later, I was just embarrassed.</span> Or she could say, <span class="_quotespan">I realized halfway there that it was too risky to show up there, even with my boyfriend. He was more freaked out than I was.</span></li>
     </ul>
    </td>
   </tr>

 </div>
 <p>Either way, the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> and the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> get to note their level of satisfaction with <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span>.com.</p>

<h1>Payment</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>All <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> are subscribers and when members sign up, they include the details of how to pay and get paid.</li>
  <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> transfer method is debited to pay for the milk.</li>
  <li>If the <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> had to pay, say, in cash for the milk, then that amount will be credited to her transfer account.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Interventions</h1>
 <p>Groups of <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> can organize to deal with emergency situations nearby,<a href="#en05"><sup id="bm05">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> from drug usage interventions to potential suicides.</p>
 <p>They can register their group with <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> as a community resource.</p>
 <p>They&rsquo;d be alerted when the system detects a pattern that fits their target.</p>

<h1>Reuniting Friends and Family</h1>
 <p>&ldquo;Looking for John Martinez. Graduated in 1972 from Schurz HS in Chicago. Last time we were in touch he still lived in Chicago."</p>
 <p>Not clear how this kind of request can leverage the platform.</p>

<h1>Baby Sitting, Elder Sitting</h1>
 <p>Seems obvious.</p>
 <p>BTW, what this brings up is the importance of reputation for members.</p>

<h1>Fun <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span></h1>
 <p>As Jose says,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Pub crawls</li>
   <li>Movie Nights</li>
   <li>Movie <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> (<span class="_quotespan">who likes going to the movies by themselves?</span>)<a href="#en20"><sup id="bm20">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></li>
  </ul>

<h1>Vendors Will Know</h1>
 <p>We can train retailers to tell people who call in an order that, there are two people near you coming to pick up soon. If you put in a rBuddyNeighbors request, maybe one of them will deliver.</p>
 <p>This means that we need a UI for vendors to see rBuddyNeighbors activity that impacts them,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Requests that mention them</li>
   <li>Comments related to them (good/bad)</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Mom-and-Pops (1/26/2019)</h1>
 <p>During a conversation, Minesh Patel brought up the use case of a local mom-and-pop store who may deliver a request themselves. It could be that they know the requester as a <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> or as a regular customer. Or the requestor lives within their back route and the local grocers can easily deliver it on the way home. This would fit within the model.<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>-owner cannot charge or add a surcharge for the delivery itself. Tips are not allowed, because it is not about making a living, it is about connecting and &rsquo;s simply being a <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> to a <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>.</p>
 <p>This could be <span class="_quotespan">gamed&rdquo; if the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>-owner hires one or more people to deliver these requests. This would go against the principle of connecting people IRL. A &ldquo;delivery</span> person would not make the kind of connection we are aiming for between <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>s. This can easily be detected by the <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> and reported to the platform. It would end up in a conversation, probably between the grocer anb the affected <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>. Again, connection.</p>

<h1>Together IRL</h1>
 <p>The town of Kamikatsu, Japan, recycles 81% of its waste. You can read read more about it<a href="#en21"><sup id="bm21">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>.</p>
 <p>The <em>collection center</em> mentioned in the articles is another place for <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>s to have a positive meeting in real life. This is the kind of thing that a neighborhood can organize through <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span>.</p>

<h1>Food</h1>
 <p>Some people love to cook. Others, like myself, just eat. I can appreciate when I like a dish, but that&rsquo;s it. If anybody asks, I&rsquo;ll say, <span class="_quotespan">it&rsquo;s good;&rdquo; sometimes I&rsquo;ll even say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really good.</span></p>
 <p>Even the people who like to cook, sometimes feel like not cooking. It&rsquo;s like harking for a special dish, but you don&rsquo;t want to cook. No matter, you still have to eat.</p>
 <p>So, here&rsquo;s other potential <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> scenarios,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <table class="_background" style="width:90%; ">
    <tr>
     <th>Scenario 1</th>
     <td>
      <ul>
       <li>You&rsquo;d like to eat anything.</li>
       <li><span class="_quotespan">What do you have?</span></li>
      </ul>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Scenario 2</th>
     <td>
      <ul>
       <li>You&rsquo;d like to eat a dish that your aunt made.</li>
       <li>You don&rsquo;t have the recipe, but you can reach out to your aunt.</li>
       <li>You connect your aunt with the <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> cook on a video call.</li>
       <li>They figure out how to reproduce the dish. They may have to figure out alternative ingredients to use if your aunt&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t be found locally.</li>
       <li><span class="_quotespan">There&rsquo;s a <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> at <em>Trader Joe</em>&rsquo;s who can get me the missing ingredients in a half hour. I can have it ready for you a half hour after she gets here.</span></li>
      </ul>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Scenario 3</th>
     <td>
      <ul>
       <li><span class="_quotespan">Can I get my aunt&rsquo;s dish? For three, this time. It turned out that it was as good as I remember her food and I want my friends to get a taste it.</span></li>
      </ul>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </div>
 <p>You can pick up the food yourself (it&rsquo;s nearby), or you can have it delivered by a <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span>.</p>
 <p>The emphasis is in the cooking; the delivery is handled by the fact that the cooking is done nearby, in the <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> sense.</p>

<h1>Commuting</h1>
 <p>This can also apply to commuting, either as a one time thing, or on a regular basis. <span class="_quotespan">I need to get to San Carlos tomorrow by 10 am.</span> Or, <span class="_quotespan">I work in Mountain View, looking for a <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbor</span> to commute with.</span> The response from the system could be three potential <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbor</span>s, or other commuters that are open to another rider.</p>
 <p>It would be commuting with people who live nearby. People that you may even know. People you can have a lasting relationship with.</p>

<h1>International</h1>
 <p>Has to work anywhere in the world, and across borders. See <em>Pickups</em>, below, under <em>Termimology</em>.</p>
 <p>For example, I can put in a request for Coyotas del Parque, Hermosillo. Somebody from my neighborhood who happens to be in Hermosillo, picks up my order and brings it. Since we live nearby, my <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> let&rsquo;s me know when I can pick them up at his place.</p>

<h1>Group Invitations (Community Organizing)</h1>
 <p>The scenario is like this, I hear that there&rsquo;s going to be a demonstration outside the office of a local politician. The organizers went to <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbor</span>s and announced their multi-location event. I ask for the details and the system sends my request to the organizer(s). They contact me with the details and I make arrangements to go.</p>
 <p>The system may recommend two or three people that you&rsquo;ve interacted with before who are also going to the demonstration.</p>

<h1>Deplorables</h1>
 <p>Group Invitations opens the door to Nazi rallies, or white supremacist groups. Tread carefully.</p>

<h1>Them Deviants</h1>
 <p>You just know that people will try to use this for prostitution, distribution of illegal drugs, and other less desirable activities.</p>
 <p>Regardless of everything else, this would go against our impact, our purpose, and corrupt our mission. So, we&rsquo;d probably have to do something about it, but &hellip; TBD.</p>
 <p>Scanning requests will not work after a short while, and people will go crypto on us (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="_quotespan">Looking for a one-night-stand. I&rsquo;ll pay $300&rdquo; will become <span class="_quotespan">Looking for my friend, Mike. I want to return his $300.</span> Maybe we can spot patterns (<em>e.g.</em>, the same person always responds to the &ldquo;Mike</span> requests).</p>
 <p>When we detect any of this, we can kick out John and Mike (and return their membership fees). But would we also alert law enforcement? We would not have to because we are looking for and finding behavior that goes against the platform&rsquo;s terms of use. Whether that is also illegal or not, it is not necessarily for us to judge.</p>
 <p>What about the case where a kid gets illegal drugs this way and overdoses?</p>
 <p>Do we alert the nearby <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span>s for potential intervention?</p>

     <p>It makes sense to let members define what <span class="_quotespan">near&rdquo; and &ldquo;detour</span> mean. There could be a,</p>

<h1>Revenue</h1>
 <ul>
  <li><span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> pay a membership fee to become <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span>.com members. That&rsquo;s (mostly) it. This will be a very small fee and the top-line growth for <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span>.com is based on that. Our financial success is based on volume with lots (and lots) of people signing up.</li>
  <li>We will also pay and collect for the goods, but there won&rsquo;t be any markup.</li>
  <li>Buddies may get rewards for their service. The trick is not to let these <span class="_quotespan">rewards</span> become the goal for members. The goal is for Neighbors to get to know other Neighbors. For example, they may get valuable reward for their community.</li>
  <li><span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> are our only paying customers. They and their neighborhoods must be the primary beneficiaries. I believe that our democracy will be the ultimate beneficiary.</li>
  <li><span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span>&rsquo;s purpose is to make it easy to have Neighbors meet each other in real life, being serviciable to one another, bonding over a good deed done, a good deed received.</li>
  <li><span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> does not depend on goods outlets or any other revenue. Members are customers. Clear and simple.</li>
  <li>Outlets can contribute to local funds and projects on behalf of <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span>. Not, <span class="_quotespan">Check out your Tuesday discounts&rdquo; but &ldquo;come Tuesday and get your <span class="_paradigm">rBuddyNeighbors</span> and we&rsquo;ll contribute X% of all sales to &hellip;</span></li>

     This is conceptually OK with bringing goods to a <span class="_paradigm">Neighbor</span> so long as it doesn't take her too far off her route.
     The "too long" here is too vague at this point. It will become more concrete when a specific request shows up. Then, each <span class="_paradigm">Buddy</span> can make up her mind to accept or not.
