 <p>It used to be that the bad guys were the owners of <em>the means of production</em>, but that is not the problem, certainly not today.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>For a long time, the bad guys were the owners of <em>the means of production</em>. But that is not the problem, certainly not today. Yes, there were bad guys and they did a lot of harm, but beneath it all this bad stuff, there was a system that rewarded competition and dominance. It is still going, though with a nicer face, and we still live in it today. It has been nameless, but we now call it the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> way, "Do it my way, or else! Please."</p>
 <p>What we are missing today is <em>dignity</em>. Attaboys are not <em>recognition</em>.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>your peers recognize your contributions. They can do this fairly and efficiently because they are working side by side with you.</li>
  <li>Your contributions have to be made tangible (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s determine your percentage of whatever is up for distribution: money, ownership, etc.).</p>
 </ul>

<h1>The <em>RADs!</em> App</h1>
 <p>This is exactly what the <em>RADs!</em> app does,</p>
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Recognized Contributions</strong>. It lets everybody recognized what they see as your contributions. You may be surprised what comes natural to you but others see as near superhero behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Conversion</strong>. The app converts these contributions to <span class="_paradigm">RADs</span>.</li>
  <li><strong>Tangible</strong>. The number of <span class="_paradigm">RADs</span>s you get determines your percentage of all <span class="_paradigm">RADs</span>s given. This means that <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s can factor money, ownership, and whatnot.</li>
 </ul>
