<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>We can put <span class='_paradigm'><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span></span> to rest, but we have to go to the source.</p>
 <p>The key step is recognizing <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>.  And don’t try to “fix” <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>.  Everything you feel uncomfortable about is pointing you in the right direction. Challenge the entire <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> premise and find an alternative.</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is the result of systemic, not individual, inadequacy. It has never really been about whether you and you cannot be qualified enough, or smart enough, or prepared enough. You are destined to lose.</p>
 <p>It is about the barriers that are designed to keep us as non-owners in the first place. It is owners looking around and saying that the biggest problem you face isn’t your health and your integrity.</p>
 <p>What owners say is that the problem is us. Anything to keep our concentration on our own inadequacies, not the system that is set against us.</p>
 <p>Which means that our job isn’t to see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> at all. You are fish and <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is the water you live in. That is according to the owners.</p>
 <p>Our focus must be not on fixing ourselves and more on healing a broken world. Marginalized people have been leading that fight against systemic injustice for generations, but in an unfocused way. Now all of us need to take all the energy we use to change ourselves and put it toward <em>changing the world</em>.</p>
 <p>If we do that, we can create a society in which we see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> and we laugh and celebrate.</p>
 <p>Getting there will be the work of what is left of my  lifetime. Use the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> Foundation as your measuring stick and fix the world.</p>
 <p>Make our case, lead our movement, pursue whatever it is we want to pursue. Live as if <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is the past and a made up system, because it is.</p>
