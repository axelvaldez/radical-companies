 <p>In a traditional <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business, there is an imposed chain of command. Most everything has to go up and down it. It is demoralazing and apathy inducing.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>In a traditional <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> business, there is an imposed chain of command. If you are attempting to solve a problem that is out of your purview, you have to consult your boss. If your boss can&rsquo;t make a unilateral decision, he must pass it up the chain of command even if it is something that you can solve with a few resources. This is particularly true if it impacts people or resources controlled by another boss.</p>
 <p>We experience a lot of this in the form of email chains,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>You send an email to your boss asking for permission to get some resources to, let&rsquo;s say, purchase a tool.</li>
  <li>It turns out the tool cost is just above your boss&rsquo; authorization limit. So he asks his boss.</li>
  <li>His boss says he needs to consult another boss.</li>
  <li>Questions may arise, which then have to come <em>down the chain</em>, to you.</li>
  <li>Your answer goes back <em>up the chain</em>.</li>
  <li>Afterwards, the decision to proceed is made. Or not.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>These traversals cost time and information.</p>

<h1>Time Loss</h1>
 <p>Time is obvious. For example, an email gets fired off, but then sits in somebody&rsquo; inbox for three days before being read. Those types of things add up and mean that a problem that is initially just a minor difficulty, can escalate into an emergency while you are waiting.</p>
 <p>Time delay is felt very directly, and it can create apathy as people get beaten down to accept how long things take. After a while, you end up throwing problems over the proverbial cubicle wall, into someone else&rsquo;s &ldquo;court&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ve covered your ass.</p>

<h1>Information Loss</h1>
 <p>Information is a more subtle problem in these communication chains. It comes in the form of fractional losses that add up as the message goes through the hierarchical chain.</p>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s say that when you send your message, 95% of it is understood. This means that 5% of the information is misunderstood or lost. In many cases, the message either sits in somebody&rsquo;s inbox or, especially when people are overloaded, they might just read a few lines of the email before forwarding it (to cover their ass).</p>
 <p>It's a loss that is experienced every time a message goes up and down the chain. If the message traverses three times, you can experience anywhere from 5% to 15%. It can be even worse if a critical part of the information gets lost or &ldquo;softened&rdquo; as it moves up and down the chain. Without it, people may not even understand the message. So, a a &ldquo;clarification&rdquo; meeting is called. This means that <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> organizations attempt to combat information loss with more time loss.</p>

<h1>Dealing with Loss</h1>
 <p>For each of these problems there are a host of patches people have devised to combat them: stand-up meetings, Agile, managing by walking around, and open-door management. The list is almost endless and is endemic to <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchies and its 19th century way of running a business. But we don&rsquo;t have to accept these mind-numbing &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; anymore.</p>
 <p>Now if I just said, &ldquo;throw out this old way of doing stuff,&rdquo; it would imply a painful loss that has to be mourned. Alternatively, we can reframe them as learning experiences that can catapult us into a better life.</p>

<h1>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Model</h1>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model, communications would look something like this,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>You discover a problem that is a bit outside your purview.</li>
  <li>Luckily, there is no boss and you do not have to ask them for permission.</li>
  <li>You can not wield the entire budget of resources directly, but you can put up a <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span> for the tool you want to buy.</li>
  <li>Someone else sees the <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>, reads the description of the tool, and how much you need. They decide to give you some of their resources to help you buy it.</li>
  <li>When the <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span> is fully funded, you order it.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>There is still information loss, but it&rsquo;s minimal. Any questions that arise can be resolved in conversation with you and you may even add it to the <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>&rsquo;s FAQ. The unavoidable communication loss  that happens in <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> organizations, and that many of us have experienced, is entirely bypassed. In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model, information is refined without wasteful formal meetings. Your peers, your colleagues, who are also close to the problem are able to share their own resources with you. The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model is fundamentally faster because it decentralizes decision-making and resources.</p>

<h1>Shorter and Efficient</h1>
 <p>If my description of problem solving in a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company seems shorter to you, it is because it is actually shorter: you post a <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>, have a few conversations, and your peers support you. Even if they don&rsquo;t fully fund your <span class="_paradigm">BANNER</span>, you learn (<em>e.g.</em>, alternative ways of addressing the problem).</p>
 <p>Interminable meetings are avoided. People who are not close to the problem will likely not participate at all (unless they are curious). There is no &ldquo;covering your ass&rdquo; actions needed. Instantaneous and lossless communication will forever be elusive, but <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> supports a shorter and more efficient form of communication.</p>
 <p>Power is decentralized as well. There&rsquo;s no one &ldquo;above&rdquo; or &ldquo;below&rdquo; you, but power comes as a function of decentralized decision-making and resources.</p>
 <p>People in <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> organizations are more effective.</p>
