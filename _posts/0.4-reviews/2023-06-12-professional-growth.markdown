<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> futures are going to happen. We&rsquo;ll drag the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system around for a while, trying to fix piecemeal. Then, after coming up with non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> systems will forget about <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. Then, the carcass will fall off the cart and nobody will notice. Years later people will write papers bemoaning its death.</p>

<h1>Making a Difference</h1>
 <p>I read an Washington Post article<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> and this, which caught my attention, is what one coach said about his clients,</p>
 <p class='_citation'>&hellip; they want to go to bed at night feeling like they&rsquo;ve made a difference.</p>
 <p>Their clients are not so worried how to get a raise or a promotion, but they concerned with <em>making a difference</em>. I take this as a sign that a future with many non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> systems is going to happen, sooner or later.</p>
 <p>We&rsquo;ll patch the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system for a while. We&rsquo;ll drag around until, eventually, the carcass will fall off the cart and nobody will notice. Later, eulogies will be written discovering its death.</p>
