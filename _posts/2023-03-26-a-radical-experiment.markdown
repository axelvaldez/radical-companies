<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>An experiment usually starts with a hypothesis that can be negated. If the experiment gives the predicted result, and gives a basis for a story, it helps dissipate the tension. For a while.</p>

<h1>The Hypothesis</h1>
 <p>Your hypothesis is in tension with something, perhaps with an ideology, or with religious beliefs, or with &ldquo;known&rdquo; facts. Whatever it is, the experiment is not for corroborating your hypothesis, but for negating your assumptions. If the experiment gives the predicted result, it helps dissipate the tension. It becomes part of a new story that <span class="_quotespan">everybody knows.</span></p>
 <p>A while later, other people with come up with a different hypothesis and off goes your stories and your assumptions and what <span class="_quotespan">everybody knows.</span></p>

<h1>Example: Gravity and Relativity</h1>
 <p>The canonical example of this is Einstein&rsquo;s relativity and Newton&rsquo;s gravity. <em>Everybody knew</em> that anything with mass will also have gravity and that gavity acted in a certain way. Then came Eisntein and with the implication that gravity was more complex and definitely acted differectly at the micro level.</p>

<h1>Example: Belt Levels</h1>
 <p>This example came up last Friday. It sprung from the question, &ldquo;Is X be compatible with the <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> system?&rdquo; My first answer was very much a <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> answer: <span class="_quotespan">No!</span> It took a while (<em>i.e.</em>, this <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> stuff is not easy), but I think I eventually came up with a truly <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span>, out-of-love response: <span class="_quotespan">run an experiment!</span></p>
 <p>In this case, X refered to a mentoring system based on Karate Belt level system, with senior folks as Black Belt and others below. And then&hellip; <span class="_quotespan">and pay would be based on that.</span> That didn&rsquo;t go well.</p>

<h1>The Analysis</h1>
 <p>There were two things involved: 1) the Belt level ranking and 2) money. The way I looked at it, a ranking of any sort is a no-go unless it is based on something. <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s work because they are based on &ldquo;contributions.&rdquo; So, the experiment should deal with figuring that out.</p>
 <p>Jose pointed out that they should be on the look out for not introducing &ldquo;force,&rdquo; <span class="_quotespan">A test represents force.</span> I would say that having a committee decideds also represents force as well.</p>
 <p>The experiment set up should considered those elements,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A way to determine salary.</li>
   <li>Do people feel this works for them.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Money and Rank</h1>
 <p>Salaries are pretty integral to the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system. Employees earn a wage, owners reap profits.</p>
 <p>Eventually, co-owners will switch to PRI to distribute earned dividends.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> At that point earned dividens (<em>aka</em>, profits) will be factored through <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. It might also make sense to factor Belt levels (<em>i.e.</em>, let&rsquo;s do the experiment). For example, a Black Belt who has not contributed much to anybody in the last few months, might stop being a Black Belt.</p>
