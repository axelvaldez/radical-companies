  <p>In 1901 in the United Kingdom, for instance, the life expectancy at birth, a primary indicator of the effect of health care on mortality&hellip; was 48 years for males and 51.6 years for females &hellip; in the 1980s the life expectancy had reached 71.4 years for males and 77.2 years for females. By the 21st century &hellip; attention was focused on morbidity rather than mortality&hellip;</p>
