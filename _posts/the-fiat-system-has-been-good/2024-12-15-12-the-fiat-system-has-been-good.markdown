<h1></h1>
 <p>I do not have anything else to say about the Fiat system, except that it has been good for mankind to have a goal, simplistic as the Fiat system&rsquo;s goal has been. It generated progress and it has improved the well-being of many more people than a handful of Europeans Kings and Queens.</p>

<h1>Nice to Meet You</h1>>
 <p>I have been in then US since 1969 and a US citizen since 1976. I was born in Cuba and grew up there. I left for Spain a few days before my 15<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>

<h1>My Father</h1>
 <p>My father was very influential in my life and I think he would have been a fan of the Radical system. Let me give two of the things he said,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>In Cuba there are these things called <em>cuarter√≠as</em>, a collecton of single rooms and  coomon bathroom, for poor people. At one time the <em>cuarter&iacute;a</em> near our house was for sale and a group of my father&rsquo;s friends invited him to joined them, to invest, but he turned them down. They wanted to make money, and altough he had the savngs/capital, he simply did not want to make money by exploiting poor people.</p>
  </div>
 <p>On another occassion he said,
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>If there is a white man and black man sleeping on one bed, the bed belongs to the black man.</p>
  </div>
 <p>Cuba was a society that did not have the apartheid system that the US had back then.</p>
