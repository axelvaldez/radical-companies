 <p>Here is what I meant by &lsquo;slavery.&rsquo; previously.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>n the not-so-good old days, slavery was temporary, to a harvest to a person. I got you as the enemy, you are now my slave. If you were a woman I can hvesex with you. then came America, and I mean Anglo and Spanish America, and slavery was industrialized. It was forever and your kinds were going to be ensalaved, too. It was not th result of a battle, these people, the slaves, were imported from West Africa.</p>
 <p>The English and the Spanish made a lot of money this way.</p>
 <p>Notives that I didnt mentioned the Portuguese. They made money too by importing slaves from West Africa. But here is the differenve,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The Portuguese in Brazil kept villages together. The Spanisn wanted them separated and got so pissed that they took the Portuguese to Rome (<em>i.e.</em>, and the Spanish lost).</li>
   <li>The Spanish tryed tokeepkept families together, kind of.</li>
   <li>The Spanish tryed to keep families together.</li>
   <li>The North American did not care for villages of families, they sold each individual enslaved person to the highest bidder. Ad sinde they did not are for the Pope, they sailed free.</li>
   <li>Regardless, families and villages were broken over time in all territories asthe children were sold individually and women were sold willy nilly, pesumably for work but also for sex, which produced children&hellip;.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Then Europe forbid slavery and eventually it stopped. But not the US. We fought a war instead between the old-fashioned slaver Statesand the new fashioned States (here you to pay attention).</p>
  <p>You see the Northen States had figured a new form of sclavitud, but could not explain it except with bullets and cannons. They called it freedom, for lack of better word wich could have been New Slavery. And it applied to back or white skin: if you were not wealthy, you were a slave to your survival. And that survival came oin the form of vry low wages.</p>
  <p>And that is why I refer to jobs are slavery. Instaed of slavery to one owener, slavery to the rich. And capitalism and Fiat does not care so long as money accumulation happens. If we have a job, we are slaves to our survival and the people that offer jobs.</p>
