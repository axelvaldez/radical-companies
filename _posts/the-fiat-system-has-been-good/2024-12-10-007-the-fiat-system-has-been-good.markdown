<h1></h1>
 <p>Here is what I meant by &lsquo;slavery&rsquo;.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>In the not-so-good old days, slavery was temporary to a harvest, to a person, to a village. I won over you as my enemy, so you are now my slave for the next harvest.</p>
 <p>Then came Anglo and Spanish Americas, and slavery was industrialized. It was forever. The kids were going to be enslaved, too.</p>
 <p>These slaves were imported from West Africa.</p>
 <p>The English, the Spanish, and the Portuguese made a lot of money this way,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The Portuguese in Brazil kept (or tried to) villages together.</li>
   <li>The Spanish kept families together, more or less.</li>
   <li>The US did not care for villages of families, they sold each enslaved person to the highest bidder.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Regardless, families and villages were broken over time in all territories. For example, women and children were sold individually.</p>

<h1>Slavery Illegal</h1>
 <p>Then Europe made slavery illegal and eventually it stopped, at leas the exporting business.</p>
 <p>But not in the US. The US fought a war instead between the old-fashioned slaver States and the new-fashioned slaver States. The new-fashioned States did not see it as slavery. The new system was so efective that it has lasted to this day, and will probably last longer.</p>
 <p>The war came about because the Northern States and the Southern States were not listening, theyn were yelling at each other.</p>
 <p>The Northern States even called it <em>freedom</em> instead of <em>New, Improved Slavery</em>. Improved beause it applied to Africans <em>and</em> Europeans. You were a slave to your survival and that survival came in the form of low wages.</p>
 <p>And that is why I refer to jobs as slavery. Youn stop working, and evuatually you will be in the poor house. Instead of slavery to one owner, you were enslaved to your survival. Fiat owners &lsquo;helped&rsquo; by offering a job. The Fiat system does not care, so long as money accumulation happened no matter how many hands it ended up in.</p>
 <p>The employees themselves tried to get rich, and many have. They had to bring the <em>people with capital</em> into the deal. It was new form of getting richer, this time through <em>entrepreneurship</em>.</p>
