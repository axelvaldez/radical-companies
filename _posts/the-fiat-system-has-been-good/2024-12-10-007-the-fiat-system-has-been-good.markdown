<h1></h1>
 <p>Here is what I meant by &lsquo;slavery.&rsquo; previously.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>In the not-so-good old days, slavery was temporary to a harvest, to a person, to a village. I won over you as the enemy, you are now my slave for the next harves. Then came America, and I mean Anglo and Spanish America, and slavery was industrialized. It was forever and your kids were going to be ensalaved, too.</p>
 <p>It was not th result of a battle. These slaves were imported from West Africa.</p>
 <p>The English and the Spanish made a lot of money this way.</p>
 <p>Notives that I didnt mentioned the Portuguese. They made money too by importing slaves from West Africa. But here is the differenve,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The Portuguese in Brazil kept villages together.</li>
   <li>The Spanish tried to keep families together.</li>
   <li>The North American did not care for villages of families, they sold each individual enslaved person to the highest bidder.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Regardless, families and villages were broken over time in all territories as women and children were sold individually.</p>

<h1>Slavery Illegal</h1>
 <p>Then Europe made slavery illegal and eventually it stopped.</p>
 <p>But not in the US. The US fought a war instead between the old-fashioned slaver States and the new-fashioned slaver States. The new-factioned States may not even have been aware that it was slavery, but it was a step forward acoording to the Fiat system, so efective that it has lasted to this day.</p>
 <p>The war came about because the Northern States and the Southern States were yelling at each other. The Northern Stats even called it <em>freedom</em> instead of <em>New, Improved Slavery</em>. Improved beause it applied to Africans <em>>and</em> Europeans. You were a slave to your survival and that survival came in the form of low wages.</p>
 <p>And that is why I refer to jobs as slavery.</p>
 <p>Instead of slavery to one owner, you were made slave to your survival and Fiat owners &lsquo;helped&rsquo; by offering a job. Fiat did not care, so long as money accumulation happened.</p>
 <p>The employees themselves could try get rich, but they had to bring the owners of <em>capital</em> into the deal. It was another form of getting richer, this time through <em>entrepreneurs</em>.</p>
