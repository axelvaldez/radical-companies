 <p>Here is what I meant by &lsquo;slavery.&rsquo; previously.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>In the not-so-good old days, slavery was temporary to a harvest, to a person, to a village. I won over you as the enemy, you are now my slave for the next harves. Then came America, and I mean Anglo and Spanish America, and slavery was industrialized. It was forever and your kids were going to be ensalaved, too.</p>
 <p>It was not th result of a battle. These slaves were imported from West Africa.</p>
 <p>The English and the Spanish made a lot of money this way.</p>
 <p>Notives that I didnt mentioned the Portuguese. They made money too by importing slaves from West Africa. But here is the differenve,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The Portuguese in Brazil kept villages together.</li>
   <li>The Spanish tried to keep families together.</li>
   <li>The North American did not care for villages of families, they sold each individual enslaved person to the highest bidder.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Regardless, families and villages were broken over time in all territories. The women and children were sold individually.</p>
 <p>Then Europe made slavery illegal and eventually it stopped. But not the US.</p>
 <p>The US fought a war instead between the old-fashioned slaver States, mostly in the in South, and the new-fashioned States, mostly in the North.</p>
 <p>You see the Northen States had figured a new form of slavery, but could not explain it to the slaver States. They called it freedom; they should have called it New Slavery. And it applied to Africans and Europeans: you were a slave to your survival. And that survival came oin the form of very low wages.</p>
 <p>And that is why I refer to jobs are slavery. Instead of slavery to one owener, slavery to ybour survival. Capitalism and Fiat did not care so long as money accumulation happened. We are slaves to our survival and the people that, temporarly offer jobs.</p>
 <p>Then owners keep getting richer and the employess keep changing jobs. The employess themselves ould get rich, but they had to bring the owners of <em>capital</em> into the deal, so they could get richer, too.</p>
