<h1></h1>
 <p>I do not have anything else to say about the Fiat system, except that it has been good for mankind to have a goal, simplistic as the Fiat system&rsquo;s goal has been. It generated progress and it has improved the well-being of many more people than a handful of Europeans Kings and Queens.</p>

<h1>Nice to Meet You</h1>>
 <p>I&rsquo;ve been in then US since 1969 and a US citizen since 1976. I was born in Cuba and grew up there. I left a few days before my 15<sup>th</sup> birthday. I left for Spain at the behest of my parents.</p>

<h1>My Father</h1>
 <p>My father was very influential my life and I think he would have been a fan of the Radical system. Let me give two of the things he said,</p>
  <p class="_citation">
   <p>In Cuba there are these things called <em>cuarter√≠as</em>. A collecton of single rooms for poor people. At one time the one near our house was for sale and a group of my father&rsquo;s friends invited him to joined them to invest, but he turned them down. They wanted to make money, and altough he had the capital, he simply did not want to make money by exploiting poor people.</p>
  <p>
 <p>This was a couple of years before the birth of the Castro dictatoship, so it did not quite matter.</p>
 <p>On another occassion he said,
  <p clss="_citation">
   <p>If you see a white man and black man sleeping on one bed, the bed belongs to the black man.</p>
  </p>
 <p>And thos in a society that did not have the aparthaid system that we had then in the US.</p>
 <p>These coomments have stuck with me (did I say that I am 73 years old?).</p>
