<h1></h1>
 <p>The Fiat system has gotten too complicated for any one person to understand. In fact, that is one of its defensive moves: A complex systems separates highly educated people into specialties, and then they waste their time arguing with each other.</p>
 <p>It does not stop the future, but it slows it down. And time is money.</p>

<h1>A Note</h1>
 <p>The Fiat system, like all systems, is implemented by people. They do not have to get in a room to plan the whole thin, but the system keeps them acting as one to preserve itself.</p>
 <p>Hats off to William the Conqueror, who may have given genesis to the system.</p>
