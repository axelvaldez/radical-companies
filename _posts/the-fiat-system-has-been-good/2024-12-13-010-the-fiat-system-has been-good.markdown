 <p>Fiat has meant progress for many. And that does not mean that I am look for progress for <em>ALL</em>, but we need progress for many more tn jut a few. And progress had included that, that is what gave Fiat wide suppprt. But Fiat has not included that for the last 30 years, since Ronald Reagan for a very imple reason: its exclusive focus on growing the money supply.</p>
 <p>BTW, to me Reagan was the antithesis of Franklin Roosevelt. Reagan chose to advanced the already-rich on everybody&rsquo;s back and he took us back in time.</p>
