 <p>Back to the progress instigated be Fiat&hellip;</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>Besides medicine, Fiat has brought progress to people&rsquo;s comfort.</p>
  <ul id="_standout">
   <li>Think of the comfort of living in a house. Worm in the winter with heating and cool with A/C in the summer. Never mind the homeless, they lost the will to fight for the well being of their families or they are in some sinful state, like drunkness or drug addiction.</li>
   <li>Think of the job that exists today thanks to independant actors wanting to do better. You can &lsquo;blame&rsquo; that on the Fiat system, too.</li>
   <li>Think of AI. It is not going to replace people, any more than the mills replaced people. People just have to get re-trained, that is all.</li>
   <li>Think of all the home conviniences for the benefits of house wives. Microwave ovens, expreso machines, intelligent ovens, and even intelligent toasters. Men are befiting from these! And people that do not have those, want them and will work multiple jobs or go into debt to get them.</li>
   <li>Think of debt, conveniently accumulated in credit cards. Buy now, pay later. Sure it may take a while but eventually you will pay. You will be forced to pay because upright citizens always do so. And if you are not an upright citizen you may end im some of trouble, one that you brought on yourself.</li>
   <li>Think of transportation. Everybody has a car; well, almost everybody. The very poor and the homeless do not or else they would not be so poor and destitute.</li>
   <li>Think of the roads to you job. Those are public goods, provided through your taxes to State and Federal governments.</li>
   <li>Think of schools, and cities, and accumulations of people everywhere.</li>
  </ul>
 <p id="_standout">They are the benefits of the system we have put in place. Of course, some people fall outside of it due to maybe their goverment and the laws that these goverments enact. Just look at the shithole countries in Africa.</p>
