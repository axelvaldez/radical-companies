 <p>Time for an alternative.</p>
</div>

<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>Radical is the name we gave to the alternative to the Fiat system. In this case it refers to the roots of its governance systems and some tools. You can read how it came up and how it devepeloped in <a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup>Radical Companies</a> and in <a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup>Radical in Detail</a> you can read the answers to questions that have come up when we have talked about it and some that we made up to make more understandable.</p>

<h1>The Tshirt Said It</h1>
 <p>The renoun author, Ursula Le Guin said,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>We live in <em>Capitalism</em>. Its power seems inescapable. But so did the divine rights of Kings.</p>
  </div>
 <p>I would change it to,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>We live in <em>the Fiat system</em>. Its power seems inescapable. But so did the divine rights of Kings <em>and Queens</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Fiat is <em>bigger</em> than capitalism. Actually Fiat is <em>orthogonal</em> to capitalism.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Fiat is bigger than capitalism in the sense that Fiat has absorved capitalism, but capitalism is not an integral part of it. People who confused the two open themselves to a lot of unecessaray criticism.
    </li>
    <li>
     Capitalism is created a community of people with money to spare that are willing to risk as capital for somebody else. As such it is a good thing.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>There are businesses that need to hire skilled people and buy equipment and materials before they can ship their first product. Capital is needed for that.</p>
   <p>In the good old days when the Dutch formalized capitalism shares of the businesses were given in exchange for capital. In the 21<sup>th</sup> Century even individuals can issue capital as a loan. And like all loans they would have a fixed gain, whereas <em>shares</em> are a &lsquo;forever gain.&rsquo;</p>
