 <p>Let me mention a few Fiat&rsquo;s advances in medicine,</p>

 <p>And, of course, wars also played a role,</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>&ldquo;<em>The battlefields of the 20th century stimulated the progress of surgery and taught the surgeon innumerable lessons, which were subsequently applied in civilian practice.</em>&rdquo;</p>
 </div>
 <p>I have nothing against <em>money making</em>. But I want alternatives to the Fiat system that makes employees into co-owners so they can <em>benefit</em> from any and all transactions. The measure is their contributions and not by a benevolent boss or the capital they bring to the table.</p>

<h1>Just A Few</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>&ldquo;<em>In 1901 in the United Kingdom, for instance, the life expectancy at birth &hellip; was 48 years for males and 51.6 years for females &hellip; in the 1980s the life expectancy had reached 71.4 years for males and 77.2 years for females. By the 21st century &hellip; attention was focused on morbidity rather than mortality&hellip; </em>&rdquo;</p>
  <p id="_signature">Enciclopedia Britannica, Online</p>
 </div>
 <p>Also from Britannica,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>&ldquo;<em>The rapid progress of medicine in this era was reinforced by enormous improvements in communication between scientists throughout the world.</em>&rdquo;</p>
  </div>
  <p>And, yes, this was accerelated by money, but all the money in the world would have just sat there and not have done anything if these scientist were, for example,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Enslaved</li>
    <li>Not excited at the possibility of discovery</li>
    <li>Not getting credit.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>So, again, Fiat has balanced some things well for the sake of making money which of course, this is is not the only or best way to do it.</p>
  <p>The one thing to note is that,</p>
   <div class="_citation">
    <p>&ldquo;<em>The rapid progress of medicine in this era was reinforced by enormous improvements in communication between scientists throughout the world.</em>&rdquo;</p>
   </div>
  <p>One thing to note here is that the drive to make money sometimes results in doing the right thing. In this case it worked only because <em>increased communication</em> was not in direct competition with capital and was not taking money out of the Fiat bosses&rsquo;s pockets.</p>
