 <p>Time for an alternative.</p>

<h1></h1>
 <p>To be clear. the Fiat system has been good to humanity because it is made it possible to progress, it has given us time to grow and mature. And it has not been till the 21<sup>th</sup> with the Internet, etc., that we get to try something significantly new and different.</p>
 <p>The Fiat system, with a single focus on money, is too simplistic. Now that we are together as a world (minus dictatorships), we can handle more than a single focus.</p>
 <p id="_standout">And that is where the very simple Radical system fits in&hellip;</p>

<h1>Summary (so far)</h1>
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Fiat Has Been Good.</strong> Mostly for the people looking to make money. But making money is just one aspect of what we, people, are all about. Many others do not like to have to slave and fight to stay on the survival treadmill.</li>
  <li><strong>Climate Change.</strong> This is only one aspect of the ills that we have broumde Earth suffer. Water privatization, deforestation, pollution, and many others are just as harmful to the Earth and to us.</li>
  <li><strong>The Tshirt Said It.</strong> The As Ursula LeGuin, te author said, the divine rights of Kings and Queens were once inescapable, but now they are not.</li>
 </ul>
