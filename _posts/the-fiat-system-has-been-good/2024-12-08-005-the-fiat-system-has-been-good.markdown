 <p>Time for an alternative.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>Let me enumerate Fiat's many advances in medicine in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
 <p>Just to mentioned a few,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Thypus</li>
   <li>Malaria, Yellow Fever, Leprosy, and other tropical diseases</li>
   <li>Mumps</li>
   <li>Measles</li>
   <li>Rubella</li>
   <li>Polio</li>
   <li>Chemotherapy</li>
   <li>Penicillin</li>
   <li>Vaccines for smallpox and others</li>
   <li>Skin test for tuberculosis</li>
   <li>Typhoid vaccine</li>
   <li>BCG Vaccines for Tuberculosis</li>
   <li>Influenza</li>
   <li>DNA</li>

   <li>Cortisone</li>
   <li>Contraceptives</li>

   <li>Gangrene</li>
   <li>X-Rays</li>
   <li>Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy</li>
   <li>Organ Tansplantations</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Surgery also avanced aswell as anesthiology.</p>
 <p>And, of course, (money making) wars also play a role.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<em>Immunization was officially adopted by the (British) army before the outbreak of WWI.</em>&rdquo;</p>
 </div>

 <div class="_citation">
  <p>&ldquo;<em>The battlefields of the 20th century stimulated the progress of surgery and taught the surgeon innumerable lessons, which were subsequently applied in civilian practice.</em>&rdquo;</p>
 </div>
 <p>I need to repeat that I have nothing against <em>money making</em>. But I want alternatives that makes employees into co-owners so they can benefit from any and all transactions, measured by their contributions and not by a benevolent boss.</p>

<h1>Just A Few</h1>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>&ldquo;<em>In 1901 in the United Kingdom, for instance, the life expectancy at birth &hellip; was 48 years for males and 51.6 years for females &hellip; in the 1980s the life expectancy had reached 71.4 years for males and 77.2 years for females. By the 21st century &hellip; attention was focused on morbidity rather than mortality&hellip; </em>&rdquo;</p>
  <p id="_signature">Enciclopedia Britannica, Online</p>
 </div>
 <p>Also from Britannica,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>&ldquo;<em>The rapid progress of medicine in this era was reinforced by enormous improvements in communication between scientists throughout the world.</em>&rdquo;</p>
  </div>
  <p>And, yes, this was accerelated by money, but all the money in the world would have just sat there and not have done anything if these scientist were,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Enslaved (below I will say more about this)</li>
    <li>Not excited at the possibility of discovery</li>
    <li>Getting credit.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>So, again, Fiat has balanced some things well for the sake of making money and itmhas resulted in well-being. Of course, this is is not the only or best way to do it.</p>
  <p>The one thing to note is that,</p>
  <div class="_citation">
   <p>&ldquo;<em>The rapid progress of medicine in this era was reinforced by enormous improvements in communication between scientists throughout the world.</em>&rdquo;</p>
  </div>
  <p>One thing to note here is that the drive to make money sometimes results in doing the right thing. In this case it worked only because &ldquo;increased communication&rdquo; was not in direct competition with  capitalists and was not taking money out of their pockets.</p>
