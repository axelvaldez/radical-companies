<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Gravy is a force. Dark Energy is a force. Gravity is good, Dark Energy seems to be good. But force is bad.</p>
</div>

<h1>Gravity</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Gravy is a force. Dark Energy is a force.</li>
  <li>Gravity is good. Dark Energy seems to be good.</li>
  <li>But force is bad.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Once Again</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>A big person forces a small person against the ground.</li>
  <li>The big guy is doing a bad thing.</li>
  <li>But gravity is forcing both the big and small guy to the ground, the only difference is one is on his own legs, the other is not.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Maybe…</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>A tiger kills and lunches on a bamby-like fawn.</li>
  <li>That is bad for the deer, but good for the tiger.</li>
  <li>So, maybe some force is bad and some.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>So, People</h1>
 <p>Maybe force is bad when <em>people</em> apply it to other <em>people</em>.</p>

    <th>It is OK to guide cattle to the slaughterhouse (?)</th>

    <th>It is OK to have oxen pull the plow.</th>
    <td>
     <p>But it is not OK to force people to pull the plow.</p>
     <p>That would be slavery, and it is a <em>crime</em>.</p>

 <p>A child of slavery, the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system forces non-owners to labor for sustenance and safety. Interestingly, this is the very opposite of a <em>crime</em> in <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> land.  Heck, it is even celebrated the world over during Labor Day!</p>
