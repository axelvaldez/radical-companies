 <p>What should it be , force, or pain. It turns that that <em>pain</em> is closer to the root. And I don&rsquo;t mean emotional pain, like losing a loved one, but the kind that comes from force (<em>e.g.</em>, being hit in the head).</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>It all started with a conversation with Jose. Instead of  as <em>the best</em> label for the imposed hierarchy. Needless to say, it wasn&rsquo;t much of <em>conversation</em>, it was more like defending the trap we had fallen into and we now warmly called our foxholes. We were resisting change</p>

<h1>Getting Out of the Foxhole</h1>
 <p>The argument has been bouncing around in my head for a few days. So I took a shower (my contemplative place). As it turned out, we were meeting with proto-<span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies right after</p>
 <p>I explained what was going on and let them know that I was leaning towards getting from the <span class="_paradign">Fiat</span> system we live in. However, they had good arguments to the contrary.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradign">Fiat</span> commands always carry a threat of force with it, <span class="_quotespan">move that box from there to there</span>. The implied <span class="_quotespan">or else</span> very rarely gets said, but it is always there because I, the boss, can fire you and threatened your ability to survive. The box gets moved to avoid <span class="_paradign">Pain</span>.</p>

    alt="At the top of it all, we see the word <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</spam>. Below it, we see the words 'threat of force.' Below and to the right, we see 'Threat of Pain.' Below and to the right, we see 'Fear (avoid Pain).' Below and to the right we see 'Force.' Bellow and to the right, we see 'Pain.' To the far right of that, we see 'Wellbeing.' There are arrows connecting these boxes. Finally, underneath all of it, we see 'Survivability.'"

<h1>Be Thankful for Contrarians</h1>
 <p>As Carlos Suarez said, , according to him, contained the whole cascade from an implied threat, to real <span class="_paradign">Pain</span>.</p>
 <p>When I came out of the shower I was ready ( for now.</p>

<h1>Heart-Felt Stories</h1>
 <p>Paty (Patricia) told the story of when she got beaten down by job and she hit bottom. She decided to quit. Instead, she wanted to build a platform to make it easy for people to do things for the sake of their wellbeing. It&rsquo;s been a while, but we are building that platform, not as an app, but as a different way of living and thriving (<em>i.e.</em>, but it does include an app).</p>
 <p>Chabeli told us about her transformation by a simple act: getting over the fear of bringing up what she really felt. She was concerned about the others reaction and was scared of the conversation that would follow. Finally, <span class="_quotespan">Make it for people, not just to make money.</span> It took courage to do, but it was the right thing for her and she felt really good after she said it.</p>
 <p>As it turned out, the women that she was working with took her seriously and enjoyed and celebrated the process.</p>
 <p>These stories resonated with me. They spoke to the power of having an alternative to the  system we live under.</p>
 <p>It gives me hope.</p>

<h1>Wellbeing</h1>
 <p>A business tries to be, but a company is not a machine, and we are not cogs. We evolve and adapt. We change over time. We change to adept to the circumstances.</p>
 <p>When that gets interrupted, we start to lose our humanity.</p>
 <p>The opposite of <span class="_paradigm">Pain</span> is wellbeing. <em>Not</em> hedonic pleasure, which is more like an addiction. It is a reflection of <span class="_paradigm">Pain</span> that is already there.</p>
