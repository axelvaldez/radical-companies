<h1>Capital Is Force</h1>
 <p>Capital versus force, that is of the things that Karl Mark is remembered for: capital to buy force, versus the proletariat’s sacrificial force. A distinction without a difference. Capitalists won’t have their way anymore based on their capital. A New Man, emancipated from egotism, will rise and will run the (same) <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system on behalf of the proletariat.</p>
 <div class="_speakera">First, the proletariat will take the capitalist down by <em>force</em>. Then they will use the riches they capture to create a system that is fair to the proletariat.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Good. But how will this fair-to-all situation come about?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Well, we will figure that out as we go. In the meantime, we will hold the capital on behalf of the proletariat.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">So you will take over everything, including the capital, and decide what to do with it all, right?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">On behalf of the proletariat, yes!</div>
 
<h1>We Are Not Able to See it</h1>
 <p>Karl Marx was blind to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. He just switched the owners, from capitalist to &rdquo;the new man,&rdquo; Unfortunately, he kept the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system itself. That is like putting lipstick on the pig.</p>
 <p>The important thing is to make the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system <em>visible</em>, in particular to the people it hurts.</p>
 <p>The search for an alternative is very high up in priority.</p>
