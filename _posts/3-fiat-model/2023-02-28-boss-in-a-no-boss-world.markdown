<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>What does a boss do in a no-boss world? After so many years of winning competitions&hellip; does he give up competition for collaboration After counting on force to get things done for so long&hellip; WHAT?</p>
 <p>I guess the only thing ahead for the boss is to learn to not be boss and the people around her to act like his loving peers. The people around you are not employees, they are co-owners. Maybe the thing to do is remind them of the <span class='_paradigm'>Foundation</span>, the <span class='_paradigm'>Explicit Alignment</span>, and the commitments they expressed in the <span class='_paradigm'>Explicit Relationship</span>.</p>
 <p>No matter, the transition is very, very difficult. Embrace the obstacle.</p>
