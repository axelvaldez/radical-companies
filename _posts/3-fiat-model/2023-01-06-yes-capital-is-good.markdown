<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Capital is good and goodness. We have to fix that&mdash;and we can!</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>In the beginning,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>There were <em>land enclosures</em></li>
   <li>Enclosures decrease your means of survival and increases the enclosure master&rsquo;s, now owner of the land.</li>
   <li>The new owner of the land, nice as he is, <em>lets you</em> work <em>his</em> land in exchange for a <em>wage</em>.</li>
   <li>These wages are first paid in goods and then in coins (probably minted by the owner).</li>
   <li>Enclosures begat capital.</li>
   <li>Owners keep the profits</li>
   <li>Profits beget more capital for te owner.</li>
   <li>Capital begets the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system.</li>
   <li>The owner later builds a factory on his land and let&rsquo;s you work in it as his employee.</li>
   <li>You are now a piece of a big machine that is partly made up of people like you.</li>
   <li>Your wage goes up and you are happier.</li>
   <li>You can afford shoes for your boys; girls don&rsquo;t need shoes.</li>
   <li>you are starting to internalize the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> model of domination.</li>
   <li>You only mind your work.</li>
   <li>Then you toss it to the next fellow in line.</li>
  </ul>
 
 <h1>>Lessons Learned</h1>
  <p>As a good employee,
  <ul>
   <li>You are docile and obedient.</li>
   <li>Your work is your only source of survival.</li>
   <li>You never learn that it was once possible to find  dignity at work.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Unions Enter the Scene,</h1>
  <ul>
   <li>They make demands on behalf of you, the little people.</li>
   <li>Unions protect you, the employee.</li>
   <li>But why would you need protection?</li>
   <li>Unions make you happy, little people.</li>
   <li>Wages go up and working condition get codified.</li>
   <li>Unions are centralized and ruled by <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>, just like the businesses that spawned them.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Unions Fade Away</h1>
  <ul>
   <li>Wages keep going up, in wealthy countries.</li>
   <li>Wages go down in poor countries.</li>
   <li>Wages become salaries for very good, educated employees.</li>
   <li>Very good employees take work home.</li>
   <li>Vacation time goes up, but very good employees are proud of not taking advantage of it.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Trendy Purpose</h1>
 <p>It becomes trendy for businesses to have a purpose. Nevertheless, they are still owned by the people with the capital (<em>i.e.</em>, which, as you may remember, came from enclosures).</p>
 <p>Life goes on,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Women join the workforce.</li>
   <li>Of course, women get paid less than men.</li>
   <li>Most everybody is an employee and <span class="_quotespan">they all looked just the same</span>.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></li>
  </ul>
 <p>Five billion people have Internet connectivity,<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
  <ul>
   <li>A lot of them are getting the feeling that maybe this <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system is not working for them.</li>
   <li>A lot of them feel that it is time for a change.</li>
   <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model enters from stage left. The first alternative to <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>.</li>
  </ul>
