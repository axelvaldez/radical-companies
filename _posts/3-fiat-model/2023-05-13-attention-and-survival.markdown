 <p>Being worthy of attention supports our survival.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Being worthy of attention is tied to survival.</p>
 <p>We want to be heard. Things are not real until they have an impact on the world. Mass shootings make that impact. Helping old people cross the strees makes that impact. It is a choice.</p>
 <p>Force is another choice. Even the threat of force is tied to survival, but my survival is predominant. <span class="_quotespan">Listen to what I have to say or I&rsquo;ll hurt you!</span>. <span class="_quotespan">The community may not see it my way, but they are not going to survive&hellip; I will force them, I am justified!</span></p>

<h1>Fluid</h1>
 <p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, things are more fluid than they were in the iron age or in the last century. Change is to be welcome. We will still operate out of foxholes, but we won&rsquo;t be afraid to get out now.</p>
 <p>We can make communities with anybody in the world based on affinity and their ability to help me and my ideas survive. It is also important that I can help them. If I can&rsquo;t, if we lost that so important affinity, then we find a new community. The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system cannot support that kind of fluidity, it goes against its interest. An alternative, like the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> system, does.</p>
