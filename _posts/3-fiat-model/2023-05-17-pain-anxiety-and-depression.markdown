 <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had &hellip; soaring rates of anxiety and depression&rdquo;</p>

 <p>Dr Olusola Ajore, University of Illinois Chicago, Professor of Psychiatry, says,</p>

<h1>A Different Take</h1>
 <p>Anxiety and depression are two aspects of pain. They are different as far as our brains are concerned, but they are alike in that they cause pain.</p>
 <p>My children both suffered from depression, one of them had it worse than the other. A while back he was diagnosed as having <em>anxiety</em> which causes <em>depression.</em> He is now doing fine.</p>
 <p>Anxierty&hellip; depressiong&hellip; <span class='_paradigm'>pain</spabn> is the common thing.</p>

<h1>Post-71</h1>
 <p>People born after 1971, like both of my children did, grew up in an economy very different from the one I grew up in (I was worn in 1951). For me it was growth and opportunities all around; for the post-1971 generation it has been no growth and restricted opportunities.

 <p>I believe that this &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; of anxiety and depression diagnoses have something to do with the fact that they economy is not working for post-1971 folks. We raised our children for a world that never materialized. And so they are more sensitive to the fact that they are close to pain and there are only very few, limited ways out.</p>
 <p>The majority of them don&rsquo;t want any part of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system&rdquo;. They watched their parents go through it and dont&rsquo; want it for themselves.</p>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership, decentralized ownership, is closer to what they may be wishing for.</p>
 <p>I often see <em>experts</em> encouraging you to &ldquo;think like an owner,&rdquo; but you are not! On the other hand, as a co-owner you behave like a co-owner simply because <em>you are.</em></p>
