 <p>Lazy. Greedy. Cowardly. These are violent words, the words of gloating and  shaming. The words of competition. Typical <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> behavior, even when we are being nice.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>It Won&rsquo;t Work</h1>
 <p>Even when <em>we say</em> we want to collaborate, we are most likely competing, aiming to dominate. That&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve learned and all we see in the world around us. And, so, that&rsquo;s what we do even when we intend to do otherwise.</p>

      <li>Name dropping is a tool of competition.</li>
      <li>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</spam> world, you have to build up your credibility before people listen to you, and quoting &ldquo;experts,” “authorities,&rdquo; and other well known people builds your credibility.</li>
      <li>So, you learn to do it all the time hoping that one day it will let you get in the real race.</li>

<h1>Let&rsquo;s Compete</h1>
 <p>We have learned this throughout our lives, just by watching the &ldquo;successful&rdquo; adults around us.
 <ul>
  <li>Raising your voice to signal others to <span class="_quotespan">shut up!</span></li>
  <li>Interrupt to establish dominance.</li>
  <li>Talking (and talking) for a long time.</li>
  <li>Adding &ldquo;please&rdquo; at the end of direct orders.</li>
  <li>Repeating yourself, over and over.</li>
  <li>Even saying &ldquo;sorry, but that&rsquo;s what I feel&rdquo; after a show of aggression is an act of competition. Even if you <em>are</em> sorry, the damage is done.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Competition also means&hellip;</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Dividing people. The boss has the &ldquo;strong leader&rdquo; mindset. He is special.</li>
  <li>Other lines of division,
   <ul>
    <li>Owners and employees.</li>
    <li>Middle class and poor.</li>
    <li>House owners, house renters, apartment dwellers.</li>
    <li>Men and women.</li>
    <li>Juveniles, Adults, Old.</li>
    <li>Organized religions.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Polarized people are easier to lead by the nose. People help each other to not submit. They are a pain to control.</li>
  <li>Taking hopefulness and dignity out out of work that others have to do for me, because they are not owners.</li>
  <li>Hopefulness and dignity things lie outside the work I need them to do.</li>
  <li>Only coins count as motivators.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Collaborate Out of Love</h1>
 <p>Sounds flaky, but read on.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Listening.</li>
  <li>Paraphrasing.</li>
  <li>Celebrating.</li>
  <li>Adding to others ideas.</li>
  <li>Jumping in to help is asked to.</li>
  <li>Disagree if you don&rsquo;t like something.</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t punch holes in others&rsquo; ideas to &ldquo;win.&rdquo;</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Collaboration also means&hellip;,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Disagreeing when you think it is called for. Then working on alignment, which sometimes takes lots of effort.</li>
  <li>The capacity to create something together.</li>
  <li>To have my attractor dominate. It becomes meaningful when everybody agrees with me. It becomes practical when everybody works on it. It may take violence to make all agree.</li>
  <li>Multiple views.</li>
  <li>Moving towards a common attractor, making it meaningful.</li>
  <li>Creating the conditions for this RADICAL attractor to become meaningful to others.</li>
  <li>No violence is ever allowed to be involved.</li>
  <li>What we are doing is meaningful to all involved.</li>
  <li>I work with people who are always ready to help me find meaning and dignity.</li>
  <li>There is no boss. We align, and we work and we create. It&rsquo;s all decentralized but cogent.</li>
  <li>Everything is fully transparent. No exceptions.</li>
  <li>We consider all we do an experiment. It either works as expected, or we learn.</li>
 </ul>
