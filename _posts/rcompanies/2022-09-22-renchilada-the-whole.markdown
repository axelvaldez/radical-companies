 <p>I think we know what the rHatchery is: We want to help <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses transform into healthy companies. And we are developing tools like rCommunities and rEnchilada.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The other rCommunity so far is rEnchilada.</p>

<h1>rEnchilada</h1>
 <p>About a month ago Jose Contreras, a dear friend, told me about what he and Dr Mike Ybarra wanted to do. It was crazy talk, but I always listen because Jose oftentimes turns out not to be so crazy after all. He wanted to help people on probation<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> get started on carreers in the technology space, in particular in the area of sales. He wanted to help them shift to a virtuous circle that could keep them out of jail.</p>
 <p>He personally went through the experience of being in jail and later turning his life around. I hired him as the first sales person at Nearsoft. Throughout it all, he kept going to school, all the way to an MBA. Now he wanted to create something that would help people get to the financial wealth in this Valley. <span class="_quotespan">I&rsquo;ve had my &lsquo;aha!&rsquo; moment when I realized that I can change my life, and I want that other people to have that chance, too.</span></p>
 <p>We are just starting with this, but Dr Mike already found out that we can get a six-month program accredited.</p>
 <p>We are also thinking of also lining up companies that would be willing to take these folks as paid interns. We have a program at Encora Mexico<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> where we take recent graduates and put them through a six month program, with the last two months working with a client and it has worked fantastically well. Graduates from this program, called Apprentice, have grown to be superstars.</p>
 <p>With <em>rEnchilada</em> we hope to enable people to benefit from the Silicon Valley economy, as Sales folks and Developers. Once we get this smoothed out, we will go after other talents (<em>e.g.</em>, Artists).</p>
 <p>BTW, the name is inspired by #100devs, <span class="_quotespan">A FREE LIVE Coding Bootcamp</span>, this program was founded by Leon Noel<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> to <span class="_quotespan">help POC unlock high growth careers as software engineers.</span> The program is working fantastically well.</p>
