<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p><span class="_quotespan">Lead with <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>&rsquo;s benefits, rather than <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>&rsquo;s bad features.</span> That was Jose&rsquo;s suggestios for future posts, like this one.</p>

<h1><span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> Benefits</h1>
 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> system is an alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_h2table">
   <tr>
    <th>Co-Ownership</th>
    <td>As a co-owner, you are no longer exchanging your time and skills for a wage. You are one of many owners and have rights to earned dividends, the wealth, that the company creates.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s</th>
    <td>You give <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s to other co-owners, and they give you <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s. The <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you have determine how much of the wealth the company has created, the earned dividends, you get</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th><span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL Foundation</span></th>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>The <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL Foundation</span> doesn&rsquo;t tell you what to do, but where you are heading.</li>
      <li>Will this decision make the company more or less decentralized?</li>
      <li>Will it make it more or less transparent?</li>
      <li>Will it get in the way of people finding meaning?</li>
      <li>Will it go against a co-owner&rsquo;s sense of beloging?</li>
      <li>Will it make it harder to experiment?</li>
     </ul>

<h1><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>&rsquo;s (Bad) Features</h1>
 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is what surrounds us. It is so all-encompansing that it has become invisible to us, like water to fish.</p>

    <td>Directions. What&rsquo;s right and what&rsquo;s wrong. Values. Goals. Metrics.</td>
