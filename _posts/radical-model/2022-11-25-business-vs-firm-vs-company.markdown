 <p>The question came up again: Why not call a business a <span class="_paradigm">Business</span>? or a <span class="_paradigm">Firm</span>? Why the insistence on <span class="_paradigm">Company</span>?</p>

<h1>Simple</h1>
 <p>A <em>business</em> sole purpose is to make money for the (owners). We want to make money for everybody involved, but don&rsquo;t want <em>money making</em>; as the defining reason for coming together. <span class="_paradigm">Company</span> is about people and making an positive impact.</p>
 <p><em>Firm</em>, too, also about making money. Whatever it meant in the past when, it implies power and rigidness today. <span class="_paradigm">Company</span> is <em>fluid</em>.</p>

<h1>Breaking Bread</h1>
 <p>A company is about people coming together to accomplish something bigger than any one person can.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">Company</span> comes from Latin <em>co-</em> (together) and <em>pan</em> (bread), meaning people who breaks bread together. We could have made up a word, but we didn&rsquo;t want to sound alien. <span class="_paradigm">Company</span>, on the other hand, is familiar and it has a lovely etymology.</p>
