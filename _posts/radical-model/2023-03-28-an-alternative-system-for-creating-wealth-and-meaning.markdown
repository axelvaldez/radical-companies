 <p>The  system.</p>

    <td>As a co-owner, you are no longer exchanging your time and skills for a wage. You are one of many owners and have rights to earned dividends, the wealth, that the company creates.</td>

    <th>RADs</th>
    <td>You give <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s to other co-owners, and they give you <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s. The <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you have determines how much of the wealth the company you have contributed to and you get a portion as earned dividends.</td>

     <ul>
      <li>Will this decision make the work we do more or less decentralized?</li>
      <li>Will it make it more or less transparent?</li>
      <li>Will it get in the way of people finding meaning?</li>
      <li>Will it go against a co-owner&rsquo;s sense of belonging?</li>
      <li>Will it make it harder to experiment?</li>

<h1> Shortcomings</h1>
 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is what surrounds us. It is so all-encompassing that it has become invisible to us, like water to fish.</p>
