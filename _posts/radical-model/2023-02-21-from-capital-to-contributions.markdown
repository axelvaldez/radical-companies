 <p>We have to get away from capital-as-static-power to contributions-as-dynamic-power as the basis of our culture. Not everybody has accumulated capital, but everybody can make contributions recognized by peers, not a boss or bureaucratic rules.</p>
 <p>We can then move from today&rsquo;s capital-based ownership to contribution-based co-ownership, share in the wealth we create, and have adults act like adults.</p>
