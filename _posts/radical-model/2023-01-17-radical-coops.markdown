<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Co-ops could be based on the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model. Kind of.</p>
 <p>It&rsquo;d be fairly straight forward to do if we <em>break the &ldquo;one person, one vote&rdquo; rule</em> and swich to a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s-based system. This system would be based on contributions, not absolute equality.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>Why <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s Then?</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>You could still give your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to <span class='_paradigm'>BANNER</span>. For example, if somebody puts up a <span class='_paradigm'>BANNER</span> to clean and beautify a nearby river walk, you could give the yield of some of your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to it.</li>
  <li>When somebody leaves the co-op, they take their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s with them. They earned them and they continue to get whatever is factored through these <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. But they donâ€™t receive any new <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. Given that the total <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s goes up every day. This means that the fixed number a person takes with him goes down as a percentage of total <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</li>
  <li>Co-ops would be based on contributions.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>And Co-Management?</h1>
 <p>Co-ops generally have traditional  hierarchy. It still carries the presumption that the little people&mdash;most of us&mdash;need a boss&mdash;a few of them&mdash;to tell them what to do.</p>

    Caveat: I am not surethat would legally be considered a co-op anymore.
