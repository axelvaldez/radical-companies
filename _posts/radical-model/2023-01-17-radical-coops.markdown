<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Co-ops could be based on the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model. Kind of.</p>

<h1>One Person, One <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span></h1>
 <p> It’d be easy to do if you decided to break the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> Distribution a little and you kept the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s instead of giving it to someone else. Every day you get, and keep, a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>, and so do all your co-workers and your bosses. Full equality for every member of the co-ops.</p>
 <p>All the other <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> stuff would remain the same.</p>

<h1>Why <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s Then?</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>You could still give your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to BANNERSs. For example, if somebody puts up a BANNER to clean and beautify a nearby river walk, you could give some of your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to it.</li>
  <li>When somebody leaves the co-op, they take their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s with them. They earned them and they continue to get whatever is factored through these <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. But they don’t receive any new <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. Given that the total <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s goes up every day. This means that the fixed number a person takes with him goes down as a percentage of total <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>And Co-Management?</h1>
 <p>That was equal co-ownership, regardless of contributions, but co-ownership nevertheless. So, what about co-management?</p>
 <p>Co-ops generally have t<span class="_paradigm">rad</span>itional <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchies in place. In Italy, many (most?) co-ops have had the same bosses for many, many years. Mondragon, in Spain, has alway had a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy in place. “But they are elected by the community.” Yes, but it ain’t co-management because it is managed by a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy. It still carries the presumption that the little people need a boss to tell them what to do.</p>
 <p>My guess is that of the co-ops that decide to go <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> they will try co-management, and at least a few will adopt it permanently.</p>
