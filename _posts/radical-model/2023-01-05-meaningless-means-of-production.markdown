 <p>It used to be that the bad guys were the owners of <em>the means of production</em>, but that is not the problem. Not today.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>For a long time, the bad guys were the owners of <em>the means of production</em>, but that is not the problem. Certainly not today. Yes, there were bad guys and they did a lot of obvious harm, but beneath it all this bad stuff, there was a system that rewarded their competition and dominance behavior. It is still going, though with a nicer face, and we still live in it today.</p>
 <p>In fact, it has been nameless, but we now call it the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> way, <span class="_quotespan">Do it my way, or else! Please.</span> The <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system is as the root of a system that's driving us over the edge. It is not capitalism, it is the dominance of might, where everything is done by fiat. Static hierarchies are <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>; given titles are <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>; salaries are <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>, 9 to 5 is <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>. Capitalism actually creates community, albeit a very restricted one.</p>
 <p>What went out with the bathwater is <em>dignity</em>. We confuse status for  dignitiy and attaboys for <em>recognition</em>.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Your peers recognize your contributions. They can do this fairly and efficiently because they are working side by side with you.</li>
  <li>Your contributions have to be made tangible (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s determine your percentage of whatever is up for distribution: money, ownership, etc.).</li>
 </ul>

<h1>The <em>RADs!</em> App</h1>
 <p>This is exactly what the <em>RADs!</em> app does,</p>
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Recognized Contributions</strong>. It lets everybody recognized what they see as your contributions. You may be surprised what comes natural to you but others see as near superhero behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Conversion</strong>. The app converts these contributions to <span class="_paradigm">RADs</span>.</li>
  <li><strong>Tangible</strong>. The number of <span class="_paradigm">RADs</span>s you get determines your percentage of all <span class="_paradigm">RADs</span>s given. This means that <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s can factor money, ownership, and whatnot.</li>
 </ul>
