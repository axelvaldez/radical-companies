 <p>It used to be that the bad guys were the owners of <em>the means of production</em>, but that is not the problem. Not today.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>For a long time, the bad guys were the owners of <em>the means of production</em>. That has not ever been the deep problem and it is certainly not today.</p>
 <p>There were bad guys and they did a lot of obvious harm, but beneath it all this bad stuff, there was a system that rewarded their <em>competition and dominance</em> behavior. It is still going, though with a nicer face. We still live in it today.</p>
 <p>In fact, it has been nameless, but we now call it the . Capitalism actually creates community, albeit a very restricted one.</p>
 <p>What went out with the bathwater is <em>dignity</em>. We confuse status for  dignitiy and attaboys for <em>recognition</em>.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Your peers recognize your contributions. They can do this fairly and efficiently because they are working side by side with you.</li>
  <li>Your contributions have to be made tangible (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s determine your percentage of whatever is up for distribution: money, ownership, etc.).</li>
 </ul>

<h1>The RADs! Mobile App</h1>
 <p>This is exactly what the <em>RADs!</em> app does,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <table class="_h2table">
    <tr>
     <th>Recognized Contributions</th>
     <td>It lets everybody recognized what they see as your contributions. You may be surprised what comes natural to you but others see as near superhero behavior.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Conversion</th>
     <td>The app converts these contributions to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Tangible</th>
     <td>The number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s you get determines your percentage of all <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s given. This means that <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s can factor money, ownership, etc.</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </div>
