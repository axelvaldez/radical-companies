 <p>It used to be that the bad guys were the owners of <em>the means of production</em>, but that is not the problem. Not today.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>For a long time, the bad guys were the owners of <em>the means of production</em>. That has not ever been the deep problem and it is certainly not today.</p>
 <p>There were bad guys and they did a lot of obvious harm, but beneath it all this bad stuff, there was a system that rewarded their <em>competition and dominance</em> behavior. It is still going, though with a nicer face. We still live in it today.</p>
 <p>In fact, it has been nameless, but we now call it the . Capitalism actually creates community, albeit a very restricted one.</p>
 <p>What went out with the bathwater is <em>dignity</em>. We confuse status for  dignitiy and attaboys for <em>recognition</em>.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Your peers recognize your contributions.</li>
  <li>Your contributions are made tangible.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>The RADs! Mobile App</h1>
 <p>This is exactly what the <em>RADs!</em> app does,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <table class="_h2table">
    <tr>
     <th>Recognized Contributions</th>
     <td>
      <p>It lets everybody recognized what they see as your contributions. You may even be surprised what others see as near superhero behavior. They can do this fairly and efficiently because they are working side by side with you.</p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Conversions</th>
     <td>The app converts these contributions to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Tangible</th>
     <td> and <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s determine your percentage of whatever is given. <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s can factor money, ownership, etc.</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </div>
