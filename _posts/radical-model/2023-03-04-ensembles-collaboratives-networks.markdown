<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Jose and I have been going back and forth between networks, collaboraties, and ensembles. This is the case for ensemble.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Several co-owned companies want to get together to create particular thing. It is not a merger or an acquisition or anythig like that. What this means for co-owned companies is that they want to pool their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s for the duration of the project.</p>
 <p>Maybe it is an electric car and one company can do the basic motor while another works on the mechanical engineering involved in putting together a chasis with synchronized motors, etc. Each company can see how the technology they are passionate about could be applied to other projects in the future. They want to remain independent, ready to go their own way.</p>

<h1>Network</h1>
 <p>One suggestion is that we call this kind of association a network. Seems fine, except that there is a whole body of network mathematics already in existence and naming it so would be confusing, to say the least.</p>

<h1>Collaborative</h1>
 <p>The other suggestion is that we call them collaboratives. I have always resisted the term, because collaborative emphasizes the <em>labor</em>. But we want this association to include everything social, not just the labor component.</p>
 <p>Is there a better word?</p>

<h1>Ensemble</h1>
 <p>Ensembles are groups of people who come togehter to play one or more particulary pieces of music, a social act. Ensembles embraces everybody&rsquo;s mistakes and endeavors to make others look good. It means people coming close together.
 <p>It seems to me that the association of <span class="_paradigm">ensemble</span> with making music is more fitting than associating it with <em>mathematics</em> or <em>labor</em>.</p>
