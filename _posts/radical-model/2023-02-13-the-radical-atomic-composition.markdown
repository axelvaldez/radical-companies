 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> molecule is made up of the recently discovered atoms: Foundation, PRI, Explicit Alignment, The <em>RADs!</em> mobile app, and Explicit Relationships. That is it, so far.</p>

<h1>PRI Fund</h1>
 <p>You may not need a PRI Fund, but if you do need capital, fund it with a <em><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Investment</em>. Getting capital is an option, but do not trade capital for <span class="_quotespan">control</span> or any such <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> baggage.</p>
 <p>And, no, it can&rsquo;t be fixed “later.”</p>

<h1>Explicit Alignment</h1>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_h2table">
   <tr>
    <th>Impact<br><span class="_alignquestions">what for?</span></th>
    <td>What impact they want to make (<em>i.e.</em>, be remembered by). For example, <span class="_quotespan">Improve people&rsquo;s health.</span></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Purpose<br><span class="_alignquestions">why?</span></th>
    <td>Why are we doing this for? For example, <span class="_quotespan">Easy to get, healthy foods.</span></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Mission<br><span class="_alignquestions">what?<br>when?<br>how?</span></th>
    <td>What are doing, when, and How? For example, <span class="_quotespan">We already have a partner farm that will harvest by end the of April. We mean to sign up the first 100 customers by the end of March.</span></td>
   </tr>
  </table>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</h1>
 <p>The <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> mobile app makes it easier for co-owners to recognize contributions. It also makes it easier to start difficult conversations.</p>

<h1>Explicit Relationships</h1>
 <p>A Explicit Relationship is a guide to an exploration among would-be co-owners to make sure that they can get aligned and they want to work with each other. Even if this is a relative or somebody you know very well, don&rsquo;t skip doing the Explicit Relationship. Maybe it turns out to be perfectly boring or you may discover surprises along the way.</p>

      <li>What gives you joy?</li>
      <li>How can we help you collaborate with us?</li>
      <li>What stops you on your tracks?</li>
      <li>How can we avoid doing that?</li>
      <li>How do we know when you are collaborating? How do you show up?</li>
      <li>What impact you have to have?</li>
     </ul>
    </td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </div>
 <p>Also, please, take a look at our Foundation table and our Alignment table, particularly its Impact and Purpose.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>What thoughts do they bring up?</li>
   <li>Do they work for you?</li>
   <li>Does anything need to change or be clarified for you?</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Our recomendation is that you allot one hour each to Mindset, Vulnerabilty, and Collaboration. We have spend many more that three hours on these, and it has been very worth it. Doing it will get you to a level of trust with other co-owners that FIAT businesses don&rsquo;t ever get near. This practice creates a foundation for the relationships that are so important to our success.</p>
