 <p>Co-onwership is not a give away, it&rsquo;s selling to employess.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
 <div class="_q">But they end up as owners of my property!</div>
 <div class="_a">
  <p>Yes.</p>
  <p>But you are not giving away for nothing, you are selling it to them. Whatever you need you put down in a proposed agreement and if they agree, you&rsquo;re done. Otherwise, you negotiate and eventually you come to something they can live with.</p>
  <p>You could even say, <span class="_quotatespan">Let&rsquo;s try this for N months, put the money in a fund, and if it is not working out, you can take the money back.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div class="_q">What if I want money up front?<div>
 <div class="_a">
  <p>Your ex-employees, not co-owners, could get a loan from the bank based on the performance of the company. They can then hand that capital to you. It would probably not be the full amount, but significant enough that you&rsquo;d agree to it.</p>
 <div>
 <div class="_q">And what if they run it into the ground?<div>
 <div class="_a">
  <p>They probably will not, but let&rsquo;s assume they do. In that case you would have put a clause in the agreement to protect you from that situation. <span class="_quotespan">If they revenue goes down by X% of predicted, this agreement will be nulled and void&hellip;</span></p>
  <p>You are not negotiating with stranger, these are people that you have worked with for a while and know pretty well. But make sure the agreement is satisfactory to you, too. You may even specify regular reviews,  or something like it, until the full amount is paid.</p>

<h1>Warning!</h1>
 <p>As forward and relaxed as you see your exmployees, they are not business people. My recommendation is that you plan to stay for &ldquo;a while&rdquo; teaching the ropes. After &ldquo;a while&rdquo; they will tell you that they are ready and, wah, wah, wah, they don&rsquo;t need you anymore. Have them keep you as an on-demand consultant. The questions will come and it should be easy to reach out to you.</p>
 <p>You may have been doing too much and working harder than you had to. They will figure that out very quickly. Don&rsquo;t be offended if they say they are going to do it differently or are going to divide the work among them. This is an opportunity for you to learn, too.</p>

<h1>Happy Endings!</h1>
 <p>You want them to succeed and they want succeed. Nevertheless, keep in mind that we are trained from early age to <em>compete</em>. You were the boss and everybody submitted to you (more or less). Now you all will have to learn to collaborate and deal with each as equally well-intentioned and wanting their common work to succeed. It is going to be streneous for a while but there is light at the end of the tunnel: you get what you want and they get what they want.</p>
