 <p>Co-onwership is not a give away, it&rsquo;s selling to employess.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
 <div class="_q">But they end up as owners of my property!</div>
 <div class="_a">
  <p>Yes.</p>
  <p>But you are giving away for nothing, you are selling it to them. Whatever you need you put down in a proposed agreement and if they agree, you&rsquo;re done. Otherwise, you negotiate and eventually you come to something they can live with.</p>
  <p>You could even say, <span class="_quotatespan">Let&rsquo;s try this for N months, put the money in a fund, and if it is not working out, you can take the money back.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div class="_q">What if I want money up front?<div>
 <div class="_a">
  <p>Your ex-employees, not co-owners, could get a loan from the bank based on the performance of the company. They can then hand that capital to you. It would probably not be the full amount, but significant enough that you&rsquo;d agree to it.</p>
 <div>
 <div class="_q">But if they run it into the ground?<div>
 <div class="_a">
  <p>They probably will not, but let&rsquo;s assume they do. In that case you would have put a clause in the agreement to protect you from that situation. <span class="_quotespan">If they revenue goes down by X% of predicted, this agreement will be nulled and void&hellip;</span></p>
  <p>You are not negotiating with stranger, these are people that you have worked with for a while and know pretty well. But make sure the agreement is satisfactory to you, too. You may even specify regular reviews,  or something like it, until the full amount is paid.</p>
