 <p>Today the problem is not the colonialism of distant lands. The BIG problem is the self-colonialism of our minds which makes us blind to the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system we live in.</p>

<h1>Colonialism</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Today the problem is not the colonialism of distant lands.</li>
  <li>The BIG problem today is the self-colonialism of our minds which makes us blind to the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system we live in.</li>
 </ul>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> Hierarchy</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>We assume that the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system is a forever thing and cannot be changed.</li>
  <li>We feel the problems, but can not see as the source of it.</li>
  <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system has been invisible to us.</li>
  <li>We did not even had a name for it, so we called it <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>.

 </ul>

<h1>Co-Management</h1>
 <p>To start to move away from <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>, consider co-management (scary),</p>
 <ul>
  <li>No bosses or employees</li>
  <li>Decentralized management: everybody is a co-manager</li>
  <li>The <em>RADs!</em> mobile app</li>
  <li>Explicit alignment</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Then consider co-ownership (scarier),</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Ownership is a human invention, a tool for living in society, and a good one at that.</li>
  <li>The problem is <em>centralized ownership</em>.</li>
  <li>Everybody who contributes is a co-owner</li>
  <li>Co-ownership is decentralized.</li>
  <li>Co-ownership is based on recognized contributions</li>
  <li><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s make contributions tangible.</li>
 </ul>
