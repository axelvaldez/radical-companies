<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>We can&rsquo;t get to the future in a gas-powered car; it will take us over the edge first. We need a fundamentally different vehicle.</p>

<h1>The <span claa="_paradigm">Fiat</span> World</h1>
 <p>The world is ruled by fiat (<em>i.e.</em>, <span class="_quotespan">because I say so</span> with an implied <span class="_quotespan">or else</span>). The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> world we live in has worked in the sense that it has made things better for many of us, but it can never be just.</p>
 <p>Trying to <em>fix</em> the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> model is like trying to get a gas car to consume no gas. You can make the car more efficient, or even make it a gas-electric hybrid, but it will <em>always</em> be a gasoline fueled car. No gas, no work.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model is more like the all-electric car. Same look as a car, but it is fundamentally different. No gas, no problem.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> path will take us over the edge. The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> one will take us to a more sustainable future.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>Based on Extraction</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> world is based on extraction,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>My wellbeing is extracted from everybody else&rsquo;s wellbeing (servitude).</li>
  <li>My wellbeing is determined by my (financial) wealth and my wealth is extracted from everybody else&rsquo;s wealth (enclosure).</li>
  <li>My wealth is grown by everybody else&rsquo;s labor (exploitation).</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The injustice, and oftentimes horror, that this system engenders is actually pretty predictable,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>It feeds on enclosures. What used to be for the use by the community is now for the exclusive use of the brute who moved all others out by force.</li>
  <li>In modern times, the &ldquo;force&rdquo; can be gentle and pass unnoticed, but it is force nevertheless (<em>e.g.</em>, think of Facebook and the software giants).</li>
  <li>People are diivided by what has come to be known as classes.</li>
  <li>Classes struggle and sometimes it ends up in bloody revolutions.</li>
  <li>All of these sacrifices end up ushering a new set of bosses, but the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> stays in place.</li>
  <li>At one end, it results in an absolute &ldquo;leader&rdquo; who aims to stay forever.</li>
  <li>At the other end, it ends up with elected &ldquo;leaders.&rdquo;, that nevertheless by rule by fiat.</li>
  <li>In both cases, big money calls the shots and the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> hierarchy remains.</li>
  <li>Servitude, enclosure, and exploitation continue unabated.</li>
  <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system has the side-effect of destructing our life support system.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>This may be disagreeable, scary, and what no, but it is actually rational in the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system. We need a non-<span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>  system if we want to survive.</p>

<h1>Centralization</h1>
 <p>The &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo; is not the capital system and not this or that form of government.</p>
 <p>The bad guy <em>is</em> centralized ownership.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>The most important thing for our long-term survival is to decentralize ownership. And not for a few lucky people, but for everyone. I am not talking about tweaking a gas car, but creating an all-electric car.</p>
 <p>Maybe this was not possible earlier, but it is certainly possible now to distribute ownership without having somebody, like a boss, deciding how much to give and to whom.</p>
 <p>Today we can have everybody recognize contributions and determine ownership.</p>

    I know I am being simplistic here, but it is basically right and it is memorable.
