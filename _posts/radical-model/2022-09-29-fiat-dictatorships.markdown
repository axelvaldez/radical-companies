 <p>Dictatorships are bad for businesses and generally bad for the world&rsquo;s economy. Just look at Russia, North Korea, or Cuba.</p>

<h1>Kleptocracies</h1>
 <p>Dictatorships <em>have to</em> become kleptocracies to fund private goods (<em>aka</em>, corruption) at the expense of public goods.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Take, for example, Russia, North Korea, or Cuba: they have enough of an economy to fund the force necessary to maintain their dictatoships in power, but not enough to maintain their infrastructure or even their war machine.</p>

<h1>Are Dictatorships Illegal</h1>
 <p>Dictatorships may be repugnant, but are they <em>illegal</em>? There is no international law that I know of to declare them one way or the other, so everything they do is&hellip; undefined.</p>
 <p>At the business level, national laws make businesses legal. Given that businesses are <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> dictatorships, with all the power centralized in the hands of the owners, having owners collect all the profits is legal. And although that work for the handful of owners, it is not the best way to grow wealth for society.</p>

<h1>The Stock Market</h1>
 <p>The brilliance of the stock market is the realization that it takes a community to grow.<p>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>1790: The Philadelphia Stock Exchange is formed, helping spur the development of the U.S.&rsquo; financial sectors and the country&rsquo;s expansion west.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 </div>
 <p>It was a community of people with accummulated capital to invest, but note that its first priority was to help "the U.S.&rsquo; &ldquo;financial sectors.&rdquo;<p>
 <p>The &ldquo;all men are created equal&rdquo; US Constitution was written and signed by slavers, but its interpretation has progressed since then. We have to be thankful that the US Constituion was aspirational.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the stock market has been stuck. It went from being a pricing machine to a gambling table, with ruthless competition and predatory practices. All of this has corrupted its healthy growth.</p>

<h1>Oh, the Irony</h1>
 <p>It is noteworthy that non-<span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>, <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span>, companies will be incubated <em>inside</em> <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses. This, we hope, will transform the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system itself. As people learn what is like to be a co-owner, our hope is that they will take it to other <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> institutions, like School Boards and their local governments.</p>
 <p>It is worth notiing that non-<span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> companies are better at growth than <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses. It&rsquo;s just that <em>the growth</em> doesn&rsquo;t go into one pocket (the owner&rsquo;s), but many (co-owners&rsquo;) and therefore the difference.</p>
 <p>Oh, the irony.</p>
