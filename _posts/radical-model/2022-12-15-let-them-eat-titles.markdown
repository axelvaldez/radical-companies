<h1>Titles?</h1>
 <p>The transition from <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> to <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> will not happen in a day. It&rsquo;s going to take time. In the meantime, some people will need to be able to tell what their title is. Some people have the confidence to just choose their own title, but others do not. So how do you assign titles in a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> company?</p>

<h1>Gore & Associates</h1>
 <p>Some companies, like Gore Associates, the makers of <em>Gore Tex</em> fabrics, just use <em>Associate</em> for everyone. Your coworkers are the people you literally <em>associate</em> with and it makes sense that Associate is a universal <em>title</em> in that environment. When a person at Gore needed to speak to someone outside the organization, they would have a title to write down on a business card and make people from <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> bussinesses more comfortable.</p>

<h1>Nearsoft</h1>
 <p>This reminds me of a Nearsoft developer who really wanted somebody, an authority, to give him a title. Nearsoft didn&rsquo;t have a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy, so it would have been easy enough to give himself a title. But this person insisted that a title be <em>given</em> to him.</p>
 <p>Later, talking to him, I found out that he wanted to be acknowledged by <em>Nearsoft</em>. I said something like, <span class="_quotespan">shouldn&rsquo;t you, then, have gone to your team? they are the &ldquo;authority&rdquo; on that kind of acknowledgement</span>. At that moment we realized that he applealing to me and me reacting as the authority was what got in the way. We are so blind to <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>; it is hard to resist reverting to it.</p>

<h1>A Social Need</h1>
 <p>Sure we can be the stewards of our identity, but we can not ignore that identity is also provided by our community<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>. If someone, Mailan, is a baker, people know he as Mary the baker. If Mailan mostly yells, people around her expect that behavior.</p>
 <p>In a <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world identity comes down from above: your boss gives you a title. This doesn&rsquo;t work in a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> environment where the community reflects the qualities of the person; their role is secondary and can change.</p>

<h1>Decentralized Ways</h1>
 <p>To decentralize, disentangle. In this case, how do we disentangle the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; functions and decentralize the power of assigning titles? One approach is to have everyone responsible for coming up with their own title, like they did at Nearsoft.</p>
 <p>Another way would be to have everyone who cares assign you a title. After everyone has put in their two cents, you will find you have multiple titles. For example,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>If you are a developer, you might find that most people just call you a <em>Developer</em>.</li>
  <li>Others who have had you as a mentor may call you a <em>Senior Software Engineer</em>.</li>
  <li>The rest may call you an Engineer.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>At the end you are a person with many titles representing the many conceptions that your peers have of you.</p>
 <p>This could happen once a year, or every six months. You might find that people identify you differently over time.</p>
 <p>If you really wanted that <em>Senior</em> part added to your title, then you would have to earn it with your community, and not just by kissing up to the boss.</p>
 <p>There probably are other ways, but the result will be a much richer and dynamic conception of identity. And it would offer an ability to interface with the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world.</p>
