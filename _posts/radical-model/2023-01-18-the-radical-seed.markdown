<div style="display:none;">
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model specifies a Foundation and as such is more like a seed than a tree. Avocado versus mango, you can tell what kind of tree it is, but not exactly how it is going to develop.</p>

 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model specifies a Foundation and as such is more like a seed than a tree. You can definitely tell that it is an avocado tree and not a mango tree, but ut not exactly how it is going to develop.</p>
 <p>It doesn’t specify the number of branches or if they should be arranged in a circle or the quality of the fruit that it will grow.</p>
 <p>We hope to be surprised by what people come up with.</p>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model revolves about its Foundation,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <table>
    <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE; ">
     <th style="text-align: right">Principles</th>
     <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th style="text-align: right">Commitments</th>
     <td>Decentralization & Transparency</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE; ">
     <th style="text-align: right">Practices</th>
     <td>Experimentation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td class="_filler; "></td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </div>
 <p>How that is implemented will depend on its community. Will anybody say anything when they are making a decision away from decentralization? Will they notice that a certain decision is taking them away from transparency?</p>

<h1>It’s a Baby!</h1>
 <p>Eventually, driven by co-ownership, they will gravitate farther away from the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> world. And then the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> laws and its governance will have to adapt to it.</p>
 <p>It’s like having a baby, you hope for the best, but you model what you model and they learn from that. Each will develop starting from what they know.</p>
