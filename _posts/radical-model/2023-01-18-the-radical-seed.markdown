 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model includes a Foundation and it is more like a seed than a tree. You do not know how it is going to develop. It doesn&rsquo;t specify the number of branches or the quality of the fruit that it will grow.</p>
 <p>We hope to be surprised by what others come up with.</p>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model revolves about its Foundation,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <table class="_h2table">
    <tr>
     <th>Principles</th>
     <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Commitments</th>
     <td>Decentralization & Transparency</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Practices</th>
     <td>Experimentation</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </div>
 <p>How this is implemented will depend on each community. Will anybody say anything when they are making a decision away from decentralization? Will they notice, and say sometihing, that a certain decision is taking them away from transparency?</p>

<h1>Like a Baby!</h1>
 <p>Eventually, driven by co-ownership, they will gravitate farther away from rules. Instead, governance will have to adapt to it. It&rsquo;s like a baby, you hope for the best, but they learn what they learn. Each will grow up differently.</p>
