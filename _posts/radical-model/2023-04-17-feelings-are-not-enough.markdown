<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Your feelings are never reflected in the world, your relationships are. You can relate to the world outside your head only through your relationships. Relationships with people. Sometime via things: paintings, sculpture, or the written word, but ultimately with people. That is how I get out of my head, that is what guides my actions.</p>

<h1>Selective Listening</h1>
 <p>Of all the things that I say and do, people will select what resonate with them, what brings out feelings of their own. The relationship is based on what I say and what they hear. The stuff in the middle is what the relationship is based on.</p>
 <p>Relationships make my feelings meaningful to the world.</p>
 <p>They reshape your feelings, they make them bigger, or narrower. And your ideology changes, it gets broader and more encompassing or it get narrower and more provincial. This changes the way you perceive; it may make you more open, or more fearful, more defensive. They seize and waylay people&rsquo;s drive to belong.</p>

<h1>Relationships Gone bad</h1>
 <p>Without ongoing communications, the same relationship turns into betrayal and disloyalty later.</p>
 <p>Betrayal and disloyalty are FIAT concepts. They only make sense in a FIAT environment. In a RADICAL environment it usually is an indication of lack of ongoing communication or the introduction of force.</p>

<h1>Drama</h1>
 <p>Drama is not feelings. <span class="_quotespan">I am feeling so bad,</span> <span class="_quotespan">May God forgive me,</span> <span class="_quotespan">Now is the best because the moon is aligned with&hellip;</span>â€”that&rsauo;s drama. It is put out there as a trap for people to fall into. It is a form of force for people to fall for.</p>
 <p>Drama can also be an expression of the trap you are in, <span class="_quotespan">I can never do this right,</span> <span class="_quotespan">I am not good at math.</span></p>
 <p>Drama is not an expression of feelings, it doesn&rsquo;t lead to a healthy relationship. Drama is a force that goes from mild to suffocating; the only relationship is one of dominance over people who fall in the trap.</p>
 <p>Beware that it may all be in your head. The anthropomorphization of animals is like that. <span class="_quotespan">My baby doggies wants me to lay down with him.</span> And my invisible father will listen to me if I pray to him.</p>

<h1>Feelings Are Not Enough</h1>
 <p>They have to come out of you and anchor a relationship. And the relationship must be nurtured with communication and love (not force). Then, and only then, do your feelings become meaningful to the world.</p>
