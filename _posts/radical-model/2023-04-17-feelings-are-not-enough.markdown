 <p>My feelings are never reflected in the world, my relationships are. I can relate to the world outside my head only through my relationships.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Your feelings are never reflected in the world, your relationships are. You can relate to the world outside your head only through your relationships. Relationships with people. Sometime via things: paintings, sculpture, or the written word, but ultimately with people. That is how you get out of your head, that is what guides your actions.</p>

<h1>Selective Listening</h1>
 <p>Of all the things that you say and do, people will select what resonate with them, what brings up feelings of their own. The relationship is based on what you say and what they hear. The stuff in the middle is what the relationship is based on.</p>
 <p>Relationships make your feelings meaningful to the world.</p>
 <p>They reshape your feelings. They make them bigger or narrower. They change your ideology: it gets broader and more encompassing or narrower and more provincial.</p>
 <p>This changes the way you perceive; it may make you more open, or more fearful and defensive. They seize people&rsquo;s drive to belong to this group or that.</p>

<h1>Relationships Gone bad</h1>
 <p>Without ongoing communications, the same relationship turns into betrayal and disloyalty later.</p>
 <p>Betrayal and disloyalty are <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> concepts. They only make sense in a <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> environment. In a <span class='_paradigm'>RADICAL</span> environment it usually is an indication of lack of ongoing communication or the introduction of force.</p>

<h1>Drama</h1>
 <p>Drama is <strong>not</strong> feelings. <span class="_quotespan">I am feeling so bad,</span> <span class="_quotespan">May God forgive me,</span> <span class="_quotespan">Now is the best time because the moon is aligned with&hellip;</span>â€”that&rsquo;s drama.</p>
 <p>Drama is put out there as a trap for people to fall into. It is a form of force for people to fall for. Drama can also be an expression of the trap you are in, <span class="_quotespan">I can never do this right,</span> <span class="_quotespan">I am not good at math.</span> Drama is not an expression of feelings, it doesn&rsquo;t lead to a healthy relationship. Drama is a force, from mild to suffocating. The only &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; is one of dominance over people who fall in the drama trap.</p>
 <p>Beware that it may all be in your head. ; ypu may have fallen in your own trap. <span class="_quotespan">My baby doggy wants me to lay down with him.</span> And <span class="_quotespan">my GOD will listen to me if I pray to him.</span></p>

<h1>Feelings Are Not Enough</h1>
 <p>Feelings have to come out of you to anchor a relationship. The relationship must be nurtured with communication and love, not force. Then, and only then, do your feelings become meaningful to the world.</p>
