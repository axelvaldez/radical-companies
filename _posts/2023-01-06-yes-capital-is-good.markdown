 <p>Capital is good (and goodness).</p>
 <br>
 <p>We can fix that (we have to).</p>
</div>

<h1>An Outline</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>In the beginning, there were <em>enclosures</em>.</li>
  <li>Enclosures begat capital.</li>
  <li>Enclosures decrease your means of survival (and increases the enclosure master&rsquo;s (<em>aka</em>, the owner).</li>
  <li>The new owner of the land, nice as he is, <em>lets you</em> work <em>his</em> land in exchange for a <em>wage</em>.</li>
  <li>These wages are first paid in goods and then in coins (probably minted by the owner).</li>
  <li>Onwers keep the profits</li>
  <li>Profts beget capital.</li>
  <li>Capital begets the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> <em>system</em>.</li>
  <li>The owner later builds a factory on <em>his</em> land and you work in it as his employee.</li>
  <li>The wage is higher and you are happier.</li>
  <li>You can afford shoes for your boys; girls don&rsquo;t need shoes.</li>
  <li>You are now part of a big, human machine</li>
  <li>You collaborate with others, minding only your work and tossing it to the other fellow.</li>
  <li>You are a good employee and you are docile and obedient.</li>
  <li>You are a good employee and you see work only as a source of survival.</li>
  <li>You are a good employee and you never learned that it was once possible to find  dignity at work.</li>
  <li>Unions enter the scene</li>
  <li>They make demands on behalf of the little people, the employee (<em>i.e.</em>, you).</li>
  <li>Wages and working condition go up, thanks to Unions.</li>
  <li>Unions are centralized and ruled by FIAT, just like the businesses that spawned them.</li>
  <li>Unions walk quietly into the sunset.</li>
  <li>Wages keep going up in wealthy countries.</li>
  <li>In poor countries wages are even lower than they used to be wealthy countries.</li>
  <li>Wages become salaries for very good, educated employees.</li>
  <li>Very good employees take work home.</li>
  <li>Vacation time goes up, but very good employees don&rsquo;t take advantage of it (and proud of it).</li>
  <li>It becomes trendy for businesses to have a purpose.</li>
  <li>Nevertheless, they are still owned by the people with the capital (<em>i.e.</em>, which, as you may remember, came from enclosures).</li>
  <li>Women join the workforce.</li>
  <li>Women get paid less than men. Of course. Somebody has to pay for those wages increases.</li>
  <li>Most everybody is, or has been, an employee, and they all looked just the same.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a></li>
 <li>Five billion people have Internet connectivity.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">2&nbsp;</sup></a></li>
 <li>A lot of them are getting the feeling that maybe this <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system is not doing them any good.</li>
 <li>A lot of them feel that it is time for a change.</li>
 <li>The <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model enters from stage leftâ€¦</li>
