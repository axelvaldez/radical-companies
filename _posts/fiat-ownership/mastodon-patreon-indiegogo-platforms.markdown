 <p>Platform are good. They enable us to connect across the world, to use our voices broadly. Platforms are bad. Thay make money from my contributions. Platformas neither good nor bad. They are useful, otherwise they stagnate and die. So how to fund based on somebody other than charity or a percentage of my contribution?</p>
 
<h1>Based on Contributions</h1>
 <p>If I post on platform and my post is potentially seen by one person, then pfff. If I post on a platform and it it seen by a 100,000 people, that happened because the platform allowed me enabled me to connect with that many people. Here is the way I see it,</p>

 <p>Mastodon</p>
 <p>post * 1 reader        = 1 RAD.        1/1-N for me and 1/N for the platform.</p>
 <p>post * 100,000 readers = 100,000 RADs. 1/1-N for me and 1/N for the platform.</p>

 <p>Patreon</p>
 <p>donation * 1 receiver  = 1 RAD.        1/1-N for donor and 1/N for the platform.</p>

 <p>IndiGoGo</p>
 <p>donation * 1 receiver  = 1 RAD.        1/1-N for donor and 1/N for the platform.</p>

 <p>Where N is less than one and it is transparent.</p>
