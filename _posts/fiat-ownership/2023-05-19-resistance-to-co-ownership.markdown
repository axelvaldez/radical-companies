<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Resistance to co-ownership will come from everywhere. A safe bet is that the sole owners will say that it is a communist plot. But it will come from non-onwers, too.</p>

<div class="_citation">
 <p>Such is the nature of orthodoxy. Is is difficult to get out of, even for a heretic like me.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Resistance to co-ownership will come from everywhere.</p>

<h1>Non-Owners to Owners</h1>
 <p>People who,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Just got to be owners, or</li>
   <li>Are about to reach owner status, or</li>
   <li>Just made it into the lower middle class, or</li>
   <li>Are on the verge of leaving poverty behind them.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>These folks are more likely to reject, possibly strongly, anything that sounds like a change to the system that they have learned used to <em>win.</em></p>

<h1>Co-Onwership Is a Big, Tough Change</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership makes it possible for everybody to be a co-owner. Everybody, not just the selected few who learned how to use the system to win and have power over others. Simple as that.</p>
 <p>But resistance to change is understandable and <em>to be expected</em>.</p>
