<h1>Hoarding Is Violence</h1>
 <p>Today, money is the canonical medium of exchange and that is what we assumed in our book, <span style="font-size: smaller; ">RADICAL COMPANIES</span>.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> After all, we need money to pay our bills and as a medium of exchange to buy stuff. Unfortunately, money also supports hoarding as a way to accumulate financial wealth and power over everything, including people. This is problematic and leads to the most serious problems we face today.</p>
 <p>For this and other reasons, I now believe that we should have a universal medium of exchange, like <SPAN STYLE="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s that doesn’t have the baggage of national fiat money and can help us transform to a human centered economy.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
 <p>Like today’s money, <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s function as,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>A unit of measure</li>
  <li>A store of value</li>
  <li>A medium of exchange</li>
 </ul>
 <p>In addition, and this is critical, <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s are transparent in the sense that an integral part of each <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN> is its log of information from which potential risks and benefits can be calculated.</p>
 <p><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s are also decentralized. Companies will be the guarantors of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s: not banks, not governments, and not international accords. This will make the costs of all transactions negligible.</p>
 <p>A decentralized and transparent <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN> will make possible a world-wide market that we can all play in without intermediaries.</p>

    <td style="padding-left:1ex; ">
     <p>Throughout the rest of this document, you will notice that I stubbornly use “national fiat coin,” instead of “money” or “currency.” This is mostly to remind myself of a few key distinctions,</p>
     <ul>
      <li>“Money” is primarily a concept</li>
      <li>“Coins” are a tangible instance of money.</li>
      <li>“Fiat money” is coinage created by fiat, out of whole cloth. It used to be that you needed gold to create coins, but not anymore.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>As a <em>unit of measure</em>, a national fiat coin works like a meter or a minute and serves as a stable denominator for transactions. However, while the meter and the minute are world-wide units, fiat coins are a national thing. This makes them very unstable and fragile as a unit of measure (<em>e.g.</em>, imagine a minute being “devalued” or something being measured in 仪表).<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
     <p>National fiat coins act as a <em>store of value</em> by virtue of their fixed nominal value. This means that these coins can be used to accumulate financial wealth. From that perspective, national fiat coins do not deserve to be called “currency,” not while stuffed under the proverbial mattress.</p>
     <p>National fiat coins serve as a <em>medium of exchange</em>. This is the prevailing message that governments, banks, and the whole financial industry repeats over and over. At one point exchange was based on the value of gold, but since the 1970s the system is based on each country’s say so, national fiat coins.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> National governments talk about this as the best thing since sliced bread, and international accords have tried to cobble together a market out of them, but the whole arrangement is very fragile and under constant threat.</p>

     <p>Another common name for national fiat coins is “currency.” It means to indicate that <em>money flows</em> from one person to the next to facilitate the exchange of commodities. But national fiat coins don’t always <em>flow</em>. Because these coins hold their value forever, they can be hoarded to accumulate financial wealth in bank accounts or under the proverbial mattress.</p>
     <p>Given this, national fiat coins do not deserve to be called “currency.”</p></td>

<h1>A Historical Perspective</h1>
 <p><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s are not to be confused, or conflated, with local or complementary currencies, demurrage money, or any such.<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> Ditto for Mutualism, Marxism, or any other theory or ideology. The point of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>a is to make it possible to have a world-wide market, free of intermediaries, and with negligible costs.</p>
 <p>In fact, <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s are very similar to national fiat coins. They are a unit of measure, a store of value, and a medium of exchange, but with these twists,</p>
 <ol>
  <li>They represent value at its broadest. In addition to financial value, they account for wellbeing, contributions, acts of kindness, and all the other things that are important to people.</li>
  <li>They spread risks and benefits through society. We all share in the adventure: the burden of risk and the joys of gains.</li>
  <li><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s bypass the complications and costs brought about by banks, exchanges, national politics,<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> and the influence of transnational corporations.<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>
   <p><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s have the potential to enable a world-wide market. This will help us break out of our national silos and create a world-wide economy that’s decentralized and transparent.</p></li>
 </ol>

<h1>About the <SPAN STYLE="font-size:smaller; ">RADICAL</SPAN> Framework</h1>
 <p>This may be a difficult read and it may be worth repeating here a few words about the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> framework and how it’s different from our current world. Probably the most confusing thing about it is that a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> world would be very similar to our current world. People will be the same with all our jealousies, overreactions, and habits. They will be embarrassed by overpromising and want to sweep under the proverbial rug.</p>
 <p>The only difference—the big difference—is that the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> system is centered around our interdependence.</p>
 <p>Our current system is based on separating us: countries, towns, good and bad neighborhoods; political parties and their vastly different realities; need to know, secrecy, protection. This leaves us disconnected and drives us to isolation. Businesses are built on creating platforms to bring us back together, for a fee. This works for a world where money comes first, ahead of everything else.</p>
 <p>A <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> world, too, is centered around accomplishments and real innovation, but it prioritizes what’s important to people first, ahead of everything else, including money. We’ll still be individuals, with our own needs, rights, and idiosyncrasies. We are not going to become a number. The <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> model is centered on trust, the type that comes from community and collaboration.</p>
 <h3>The <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> Model</h3>
  <p>We are used to companies being governed by FIAT hierarchies, with an owner at the top sending down commands telling people <em>what</em> to do, <em>how</em> to do it, and <em>when</em> to do it. Here we assume a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> world that is, at the same time, alike and different from our world today.</p>
  <p>In the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> model, a <em>company</em> is a group of people coming together to create something bigger than each of them. Other labels abound, but we chose the word “company” because it has an interesting genesis: it comes from Latin <em>con-</em> and <em>pan</em>. The prefix <em>con-</em> means “together, with” and <em>pan</em> means &ldquo;bread, food.&rdquo; At its root, then, <em>company</em> means “people who break bread together.” In the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> model a company is a community of people who come together to contribute broad value to society and make an impact on the world.</p>
  <p>Rather than having an owner and a hierarchy of bosses, a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> company has co-owners and co-managers to govern and operate it. These people align themselves according to the impact they want to make, why they are doing so, and then they embark on many experiments to get there.</p>

 <h2><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s as Collaboration</h2>
  <p>As I see it, the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> model of co-ownership and co-management is the next stage in collaboration. Everything humanity has accomplished has been based on collaboration, but we have acted as if dominance by a few is the only way to achieve &ldquo;<em>progress</em>.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
  <p>Competition has become an obstacle to real progress and it is now getting in the way of the next surge of human accomplishments. Now it’s time to move on and build on the foundation of collaboration.</p>

<h1><SPAN STYLE="font-size:smaller; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s for a World-Wide Market</h1>
 <p>A world-wide market would bring us together rather than keeping us siloed by the Rube Goldberg markets we have today.</p>
 <p>We could have a single world government create and enforce a single currency. But even if it were politically feasible, it is unnecessary and a move in the wrong direction towards centralization. To wit, we didn’t need a single world government for minutes, meters, or the Internet, some of the most useful world-wide tools of all time.</p>
 <p>A decentralized, transparent <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN> is fundamental to such a unified market. These are some of the other things we would need to nourish and support a world-wide market,</p>
 <h2><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s for a Decentralized Market</h2>
  <p>We need a decentralized market to nurture the next stage of innovation and accomplishment. Unfortunately, national fiat coins are an obstacle to this. They are not very stable and are subject to cyclical crises.<sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> They make international markets very complex, very opaque, and very expensive.</p> 
  <p>Today’s international markets have been cobbled together by agreements that are fraught with weaknesses. National and international politics make transaction costs very expensive. Worst of all, these international markets are unduly influenced by transnational businesses seeking to profit no matter the harm to society.</p>
  <p>A decentralized market, free of interference and manipulation, is the iltimate pricing engine.</p>
 <h2>Decentralized Minting of <span style="font-size:smaller; ">rCOIN</span>s</h2>
  <p>We need decentralized minting of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s to take national and international politics out of it and to eliminate the influence of transnational corporations.</p>
  <p><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s are minted by companies, not any national government or central banks.</p>

<h1><SPAN STYLE="font-size:smaller; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s Are Transparent</h1>
 <p>National fiat coins are opaque. In theory that’s good because it reduces transaction costs. But this “reduction of costs” also disables human choice.</p>
 <p>In any case, the big transaction costs are those that banks, exchanges, and political manipulation bring in. And opaqueness does not reduce any of those.</p>
 <p><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s are transparent. An integral part of each <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN> is the log that comes along with them. This will restore people’s  ability to make choices based on that information.</p>

<h1><SPAN STYLE="font-size:smaller; ">RAD</SPAN>s as a Trusted Measure</h1>
  <p>A measure can be “trusted” because it means the same thing to people anywhere. So, if you believe that people are pretty much the same anywhere, you can trust <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER;">RAD</SPAN>s as a measure.</p>
  <p>In a rural setting somebody will get <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RAD</SPAN>s for milking a goat, while in an urban setting someone else will get <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RAD</SPAN>s for stopping cars so children can cross the street. The same human feeling that recognized the generosity of these acts was present in the rural case as well as in the urban setting. RADs capture that recognition in a tangible way, regardless of its numeric accuracy. <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RAD</SPAN>s, and the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s that they factor, can be trusted because people decide what is <em>a contribution that deserves to be recognized</em>.</p>

<h1><SPAN STYLE="font-size:smaller; ">RAD</SPAN>s Represent Contributions</h1>
 <p>This idea originated with entrepreneur and pioneer Philip Rosedale,<sup id="fnref10"><a href="#fn10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p>
 <ul>
  <li>As the company grows, every month an equal amount of cash and shares of the company are earmarked for distribution.</li>
  <li>Every member gets an equal portion of this cash and shares which represent the wealth the company generated.</li>
  <li>Rather than keeping them for themselves, people give this money and shares out to <b>anybody</b> they feel has contributed during the month.</li>
  <li>There is no set criteria and each person decides <b>who</b> should be recognized, <b>what</b> should be recognized as a contribution, and <b>how much</b> of this wealth to give to others.</li>
 </ul>
 <p><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> Distributions are very similar, but instead of cash or stocks, it uses <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RAD</SPAN>s, a dimensionless unit. At the end of each Distribution the total number of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RAD</SPAN>s allocated to each person represents their (dynamic) <a href="#VaryingBuyingPower">percentage of ownership</a> of the broad value created by a company.</p>
 <p>Because this broad value accounts for things other than financial value, <em><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RAD</SPAN>s account for the uncountable</em>.<sup id="fnref11"><a href="#fn11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> And because <em><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s are factored through <span style="font-zise: smaller; ">RAD</span>s</em>, they represent broad value as well. In other words, each person's share of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s is a function of their contributions and reflects the full spectrum of human values, not just financial value.</p>

<h1><SPAN STYLE="font-size:smaller; ">rCOIN</SPAN> Qualities</h1>
 <p>These are, in no particular order, a few of the qualities that a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN> must have,</p>
 <h3>Decentralized Minting of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s</h3>
  <p><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s are minted by companies, not a national government.</p>
  <p style="font-family: courier new; text-align: center; width: 75%; border: silver dotted 1px; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px; ">
   <img src="/assets/img/en-decentralized-minting.svg" alt="A company gets REVENUE, at the top, and sends COINs out to the world, at the bottom. In parallel, a company mints its own COINs, as needed, and they go out to the world mixed in with REVENUE COINs." title="Decentralizd Minting" style="align: center; "></p>
  <p>For example, BenCO mints 30,000 <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</span> and promises to repay them in three years. All this information goes on a transparent digital store (<em>e.g.</em>, blockchain or similar secure) that would include, at a minimum,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The amount of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</span> (30,000),</li>
   <li>The name of the company which minted them (BenCO),</li>
   <li>The retiring terms (three years),</li>
   <li>The repayment terms (10,000 <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</span>/year).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This can result in any of these scenarios,</p>

    <td>&nbsp;</td>
   </tr>
  </table>
  <p>A seller’s app can calculate a risk factor based on the BenCO <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</span>’s log <em>and</em> her particular preset parameters. Each of us can let the apps do the calculations and, based on that, decide whether or not to take the BenCO <span style="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</span>s as payment.<sup id="fnref12"><a href="#fn12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup></p>
 <h2><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s Are Stable</h2>
  <p>In today’s system of exchange, “reserve currencies” are used for international transactions. This makes these transactions very expensive.</p>
  <p>As of this writing, the four most widely held “reserve currencies” are the US dollar (&dollar;), the European Euro (&euro;), the Japanese Yen (&yen;), and the UK Pound Sterling (&pound;). These national fiat coinage are backed up by strong, stable economies. At least, that’s how the story goes.</p>
 <h2>Companies as Guarantors of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</span>s</h2>
  <p>National economies are not as stable as all that and financial crises happen on a cyclical basis.<sup id="fnref13"><a href="#fn13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> For another, people invariably find ways to exploit some aspect of the financial system for private gain. Politicians are very good at this and manipulate national economies shamelessly. For example, in 1971 then President Nixon renounced gold as a standard and blamed it mostly on De Gaulle’s policies. In reality, he did it to maintain “global economic dominance and to improve economic conditions at home.”<sup id="fnref14"><a href="#fn14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup></p>
  <p>By comparison, companies are extremely stable because their reputation depends solely on how effective they are at creating value for society. That’s it. The worst that can happen is that a company mints <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s and then it is not able, or willing, to retire the debt. The financial impact of this would be insignificant; to wit, this is what happens today.</p>
 <h2><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</span>s Are (Not) Fungible</h2>
  <p>In today’s financial model, to be effective as a medium of exchange, money must be fungible—one coin is indistinguishable from all others. “Trying to use a non-fungible good as money results in transaction costs of individually evaluating each unit of the good before an exchange can take place.”<sup id="fnref15"><a href="#fn15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></p>
  <p>Thankfully, <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s are fungible, world-wide, as a class. Their transaction costs, nationally and internationally, are negligible.</p>
  <p>But, also thankfully, they are not fungible individually. Each <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN> carries information about its genesis and history and this translates to a different level of risk associated with each one. Their only transaction cost is that of “evaluating” whether or not to accept the risk associated with it. But this can be automated and it is insignificant. To decide whether to accept a given mix of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s as payment carries no financial cost since most transactions would be driven by the app’s results and the few exceptions to it would be driven by people to people relationships. This takes those transactions out of the financial realm and into a people-to-people one.<sup id="fnref16"><a href="#fn16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></p>
 <h2><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</span>s Represent Broad Value</h2>
  <p>To be robust, a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN> needs to be tied to value creation, and <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</SPAN>s are. In fact they represent more than financial value. Their value also represents wellbeing, acts of kindness, and whatever else people consider important. And since COINs are factored through <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RAD</span>s they represent broad value contributions as well.</p>
  <p>For example, if the RADs that have been allocated to me amount to 10% of the total and yours to 20%, this means that our fellow co-owners decided that you contributed twice as much as I did. As a result you get twice as many COINs as I do.</p>
 <h2><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</span>s Transparent</h2>
  <p>National fiat coins are opaque. We make do with things like GDP, but GDP and others like it don’t measure anything besides financial value. They are canonical examples of the Broken Window Fallacy and don’t take into account society-wide costs. What’s more, these indices can be very misleading, and “GDP can increase after a car accident or a major flood. GDP can grow rapidly during a war or after a terrorist attack.”<sup id="fnref17"><a href="#fn17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></p>
  <p>COINs are transparent and we need them to be. Each COIN carries with it a log of all the information necessary to calculate the potential risks and benefits associated with it. Given that information, each of us can then decide whether or not to accept a particular COIN as payment.</p>
 <h2><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</span> Value</h2>
  <p>The face value of national fiat coins is fixed forever. At least, that is true for reserve currencies. Other national fiat coins are not so lucky: their face value stays put, but their purchasing  power fluctuates, sometimes wildly.</p>
  <p><SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</span>s have a face value of one. It is backed by people who come together as <span style="font-size: smaller; ">RADICAL COMPANIES</span> to create broad value for society. It is free from national and international politics and manipulation.</p>
  <p>The face value of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">rCOIN</span>s never changes but the information in its log may. Based on all of that, each of us gets to decide whether or not to accept the COINs given the risks and benefits indicated in its log.</p>
 <h2>Different Companies, Different Values</h2>
  <p>As it is today, different companies will end up with different values and their co-owners will have more or less purchasing power. For example.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Company BenCO earns 100 COINs.</li>
   <li>Company JerryCo earns 1,000 COINs.</li>
   <li>JerryCo’s <em>value</em> is higher than BenCO.</li>
   <li>JerryCO <em>people earn more COINs</em> than those at BenCO.</li>
  </ul>
 <h2>Companies as Guarantors</h2>
  <p>COINs are backed up by the <span style="font-size: smaller; ">RADICAL COMPANIES</span>, not national governments. This means that the COIN’s “value” is determined by what each company brings to society and by its co-owners’ sensitivities.</p>
  <p>This last bit is really important.</p>
  <p>In today’s businesses, the owners can do whatever they want. Although the same is technically true for a <span style="font-size: smaller; ">RADICAL COMPANY</span> it will be a lot more unlikely that all co-owners would agree to do something that goes against their own values and communities.</p>
  <p>For example, if a community feels harmed by the actions of CarelessCO they can make their case to a few of its co-owners to at least get a conversation going. If the harm affects many such communities and all its co-owners refuse to engage, they can simply record the failed discussion to CarelessCO’s COINs. Some people may interpret this as a high risk (to society) while others may see it differently. We all get to decide.</p>

<h1><span style="font-size:smaller; "jospoint>rCOIN</span> Risks and Benefits</h1>
 <p>There is plenty of evidence that shows that a currency, one that actually actually flows, can benefit a society,<sup id="fnref18"><a href="#fn18" rel="footnote">18</a></sup> while money stuffed under a mattress only benefits the hoarder.</p>
 <p>People have figured out that, in today’s world, one way to keep money flowing is by having it lose its value over time (<em>i.e.</em>, there is no point in hoarding it because it will “rot”). This can be done by inflation or demurrage. Inflation, the decline of purchasing power, has been the preferred method of national governments for controlling the value and availability of its coinage. Governments can do this by several means, including by tweaking interest rates, which impacts the supply of national fiat coins. We all know that “inflation is bad,” but we cannot do anything about it.</p>
 <p>The other approach is by demurrage, where coins <em>lose</em> their value over time. There’s been a number of local deployments of demurrage coins and they are generally beneficial to the local economy. However, as far as I know, demurrage has never been used at a national level. The poster child of demurrage is the &ldquo;Miracle of Wörgl."&rdquo;<sup id="fnref19"><a href="#fn19" rel="footnote">19</a></sup>. During the Great Depression, the town of Wörgl, Austria, was quickly running out of money, like most of the world. The mayor issued Wörgls to pay people for doing local jobs and the local shops agreed to accept them. The bills had to be stamped every week in order to keep them valid, and every stamp reduced the value of these coins. This kept the notes in circulation. So much so, that people even paid taxes earlier rather than let their currency “rot.”</p>

 <p>One problem with demurrage is that the rate of decay is not tied to value creation or anything like it. The Wörgl, and others like it, kept its face value for a week and went down in value every week thereafter. The W&auml;ra, another demurrage coin, lost 1% of its value every month.<sup id="fnref21"><a href="#fn21" rel="footnote">21</a></sup> Regardless of their good intentions, these rates of decay are picked out of thin air.</p>
 <p><span style="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</span>s, on the other hand, are always the same value. What changes is the potential risks and benefits associated with the company that engendered it. Every COIN carries a log of all the information people need to decide whether or not to accept it.</p>
 <p style="font-family: courier new; text-align: center; width: 75%; border: silver dotted 1px; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px; ">

When COINs have high RISKS and high BENEFITS, there is high resistance to accepting them. " title="COIN RISKS and BENEFITS">
 </p> 
 <h2>Calculating Risk</h2>
  <p>A <span style="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</span>‘s log may include, for example, the number of co-owners that agree to its mint, the company’s revenue history, how many COINs the company has minted, and the company’s debt performance. Given the <span style="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</span>’s log, we can calculate the risk associated with every <span style="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</span> and decide whether or not to accept a particular <span style="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</span> as payment.</p>
  <p>One side-effect of this, is that people will try to dilute what risk they hold by paying with a combination of low and high risk <span style="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</span>s, enough of each to make the risk acceptable to the seller.<sup id="fnref22"><a href="#fn22" rel="footnote">22</a></sup></p>
 <h2>Calculating Benefits</h2>
  <p>Over time, companies will go up in value because they get very efficient, benefit from high demand, or both. People will likely hold on to their COINs. It may be that they are more comfortable with risk and may not mind taking higher risk COINs from fledgling companies. It may also be that even the more conservative folks may be tempted to take high risk COINs from high potential companies.</p>

 <h3>Other Value Factors</h3>
  <p>Other things that may affect company value,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>As a company creates more value, it gets more revenue, and it generates more COINs. The revenue COINs are allocated according to each person’s broad contributions. Co-owners decide what is a broad contribution according to the value they perceive.</li>
   <li>If a company walks away from debt,<sup id="fnref23"><a href="#fn23" rel="footnote">23</a></sup> it’s reputation goes down, and its COINs go down in value.</li>
   <li>As a company retires debt, its reputation goes up, and its COINs go up in value.</li>
   <li>If the reputation and value of a company goes up, its COINs go down in risk. Those who took its COINs when they were high risk now have more desirable COINs. The upside spreads throughout society.</li>
   <li>Companies that are constantly creating debt and not retiring it, will find themselves isolated. Their COINs will get riskier and riskier and they will be acceptable to fewer and fewer people. Hopefully, they will see guidance and help from others.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>TA-DA!</h1>
 <p><span style="font-size: smaller; ">RAD</span>s account for what so far has been unaccountable. People get to decide what a contribution is and by doing so they “measure” what has been unmeasurable: an act of kindness, spontaneous help. Co-owners get <span style="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</span>s according to the percentage of RADs they have and that makes COINs a much broader measure than just financial value.</p>
 <p>Companies mint <span style="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</span>s. This means that <span style="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</span>s are decentralized and free of interference by national and international politics, financial institutions, and too-big-to-fail transnationals. <span style="font-size: smaller; ">rCOIN</span>s will make it possible to create a world-wide market that Adam Smith would be happy with.<sup id="fnref24"><a href="#fn24" rel="footnote">24</a></sup></p>
 <p>The whole system is transparent and each of us can decide to accept a payment or not. It is not mysterious or left to robed experts to figure things out. Each of us can do it because each of us is an expert on our own sensitivities and how we interpret the world.</p>

<h1>BAD ACTORS</h1>
  <p>There may not be as many bad actors as we think. We probably have a preponderance of them today because 1) they make the news, and 2) we live in a system that is meant to reward bad behavior: gaming is part and parcel of the system. As we find out, we patch it to prevent other bad actors from exploiting the same weakness. But then the next batch of bad actors become wealthy by discovering and exploiting new weaknesses.</p>
  <p>We don’t normally think of these, below, as bad actors. But they are. They fall back on their FIAT world habits and are a drag on moving forward to a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> world.</p>

     <td style="padding-left:1ex; ">
      <p>One type of “bad actor” is people who “go along.” We normally don’t think of them as bad actors, “they’re just nice people.” In any case, Shui is one of them. He notices that Namir is taking more than he contributed, but he doesn’t say anything and talks to Namir. Shui turns a blind eye towards Namir's bad behavior and goes by untested assumptions. “Namir is a nice guy and maybe he needs a little bit more than me.”</p>

     <td style="padding-left:1ex; ">
      <p>The other type of bad actor is the one who gets pulled into behavior that he normally would not condone.</p>
      <p>For example, Anita, a BenCO co-owner, wants to buy potatoes. The potato seller, Shui, looks at the COINs coming from her, but declines to accept them. It turns out that <em>all</em> of Anita’s COINs come from BenCO and the company has not lived up to its promises. Shui is a very conservative type and he refuses to exchange her COINs for his potatoes. She explains the reasons why they had not made the first year payment on time, “and we will, by the end of this week.” Nevertheless, Shui is unmoved and puts the potatoes back in their bin.</p>
      <p>Further down the road, Namir sees the same log that Shui got, but he, nevertheless, accepts Anita’s COINs in exchange for his potatoes. It turns out that Namir knows Anita and what they are doing at BenCO and he trusts that they will retire their debts.</p>
      <p>Shui sees the exchange, misinterprets it, and instead of talking with Namir he goes on to accept higher risk COINs that he is comfortable with. Instead of talking to Namir and figuring out what’s going on, he falls into his own trap of assuming Namir is out to take business away from him.</p>

  <p>I am selling potatoes at 40 COINs per dozen. After the first month <strong>Ⓐ</strong>, below, and his co-owners don’t have enough COINs to buy my potatoes, but <strong>Ⓔ</strong> and his co-owners do. It may be that JerryCO is more efficient or maybe its products or services are more valuable. Either way, BenCO’s co-owners end up with less buying power than JerryCO’s co-owners.</p>
  <p style="font-family: courier new; text-align: center; width: 75%; border: silver dotted 1px; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px; ">
   <img src="/assets/img/en-rad-auto-inflation-a.svg" alt="Two tables. Three rows each. For BenCO: first row is EARNED DIVIDENDS (in RADICAL COINs); +100 New for a TOTAL of 100 COINs.

<h1>FAQ</h1> 
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Companies minting COINs without any rules sounds really, really crazy!</h3>
  <p>If that sounds “crazy,” then the financial system we have today is crazier. And it is business hostile, on top.</p>
  <p>COINs minted by BenCO carry a log which includes all the information related to their creation. The co-owners are motivated to retire the COINs they minted in the time promised. If they don’t do that, fewer and fewer sellers will accept their COINs. Their buying power will go down the drain in a hurry.</p> 
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Why not make co-owners responsible for personally retiring the debt?</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">What prevents a company from continuously taking on new debt to retire old debt?</h3>
  <p>Co-owners could decide to do this, but it goes on the record, so to speak, for everyone to see. As sellers detect that pattern, they would shy away from the company’s COINs.</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">What if co-owners pay themselves a huge amount of COINs and keep taking new debt to paper over it? Wouldn’t this create massive inflation?</h3>
  <p>Co-owners could decide to do this, but it goes on the record, so to speak, for everyone to see. As sellers detect that pattern, they would shy away from the company’s COINs. They may have lots and lots of COINs, but they would not be welcome by most people.</p> 
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">The potato grower uses the COINs he got from selling her potatoes to buy a shovel. But then she discovers that the town’s shovel-maker raised his prices so that he can buy metal and wood to make more shovels.</h3>
  <p>Yes, that could happen, as it does today.</p>
  <p>Eventually, another shovel-maker would appear and make shovels that people can afford. The greedy shovel maker would go out of business.</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">PotatoCO mints COINs to pay for the now higher priced shovel.</h3>
  <p>If PotatoCO’s co-owners figure that the new price is a fair price and there’s no other supplier around, it would have to do that. They would have to make sure that they can get enough COINs from future potatoes to retire the debt as promised. Otherwise, they are going to pay with a lower reputation and value and less buying power for the co-owners.</p>
  <p>People will continue to make mistakes and miss estimates. COINs won’t change human nature. But co-owners can mint the COINs they need to run their companies without worrying about the color of their skin, or their gender, or church affiliation.</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">But this means that another potato grower buys a tractor and grows even more potatoes!</h3>
  <p>Yes. This means that people can experiment more.</p>
  <p>Maybe the tractor turns out to be a lemon and doesn’t help him produce more or better potatoes. He probably won’t be able to retire the debt he took on to buy it.</p> 
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">What if JerryCO, a brand new startup with no revenue, needs COINs to get started, can it just mint them?</h3>
  <p>In this case, most vendors would likely not accept JerryCO’s COINs as payments because its COINs would have very high risk.</p>
  <p>In this case, other companies may want to help out JerryCO by giving them COINs. One or more companies could mint enough COINs for JerryCO  to get to revenue or to build its minimum viable product. This could include vendors of equipment that JerryCO needs to succeed and the quid pro quo is that they will become JerryCO’s preferred vendors.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, the investment may come from a group of adjacent companies. They believe that JerryCO’s product is complementary to theirs and will help the market grow. Or JerryCO promises to “repay” twice the original amount of this investment.</p>
  <p>In any case, as JerryCO starts to show results and a pattern of doing as promised, the risk of its own COINs will go down and will be able to pay with a mix of its own COINs and co-investment COINs.</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">What if a BenCO co-owner wants to buy the latest electric, self-driving car, but she doesn’t get enough COINs? Can’t she convince the other co-owners to pay themselves more COINs?</h3>
   <p>For BenCO co-owners to pay themselves a lot more COINs than they actually receive in revenue, they would have to mint the extra COINs. These newly minted COINs would show a lot of risks and sellers would likely not accept them as payment, particularly for luxury items.</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Do you mean that there is no possible way to defraud the system?</h3>
  <p>It simply means that I can’t think of a way of doing that.</p>
  <p>Every time I think of something, the system manages to protect itself. And it is all because of the transparency built into it.</p>
  <p>I can imagine that there could be a way to falsify a COIN’s log, but I’ll leave that to smarter people.</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Why can’t people mint COINs? Why is it limited to companies?</h3>
  <p>Community!</p>
  <p>In the RADICAL model, a company is a community of people who come together to contribute broad value to society and make an impact in the world. This means that co-owners may be motivated to mind COINs, but the risks of doing so may hold them back. Do we believe that we can retire the debt? Can we do as we are promising?</p>
  <p>Maybe individuals can weigh all those considerations by themselves, but I know I couldn’t, at least not in a balanced way. When the pros and cons are weighed by the broader consideration of a community, the final decision is more balanced.</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">What if a company mints COINs and then is not able to retire the debt?</h3>
  <p>Yes, this kind of thing will happen. And, in case you’re asking, there is no punishment for the people involved in this.</p>
  <p>The overall costs will be negligible. It happens all the time today and nobody notices. Yes, the people involved in a bankruptcy get punished, ruthlessly so. But the system absorbs the losses, magically.</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">What about people who retired on their CarelessCO’s COINs?</h3>
  <p> I think that in a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> world, “retiring” will be a thing of the past (<em>i.e.</em>, our present). People “retire” today because they’ve been putting up with their job for many years and they are burned out in more ways than one.</p>
  <p>In a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-SIZE: SMALLER; ">RADICAL</SPAN> world, the more likely scenario is that people may decide to not join another company for a while and live instead off their portfolio of RADs from their past companies. This type of “retiring” will not be a function of age or tiresomeness, it will be of choice.</p>
  <p>So, let’s say that I decide to travel the world on a sailboat, paying for it with CarelessCO’s COINs and CarelessCO disbands. There could be three cases,</p>
  <ol>
   <li>The COINs I have are pre-disband and their log attests to it. I feel bad because they had a lot of potential, but they got careless and cocky, over-promised, and could not meet their commitments.</li>
   <li>The COINs I have are mostly pre-disband, but I do have some that the company minted. The amount is very minor, I’ll have to switch to a smaller boat. Besides, I am earning COINs while on the boat by writing about my journey.</li>
   <li>All the COINs I have are the ones discredited. In fact, I was one of the co-owners who supported the minting (we were sure we could do it). In this case, I screwed myself financially, but I learned something in the process. I have to return the boat and join WiserCO.</li>
  </ol>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">What if lots of companies disband at the same time?</h3>
  <p>Then you adjust your app to raise the risk of similar companies.</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">What about people who cannot work?</h3>
  <p>Some people will be unable to contribute to a company, for whatever reason. But to their family</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Courier New, monospace; ">Is risk associated with companies or with COINs?</h3>
  <p>A COINs log includes all the information needed to calculate the COIN’s potential risk and benefits. But, this date comes from the company behind the minted COINs. In all likelihood, it would include the number of co-owners who agreed to the mint and its how well they’ve kept to their promises. It would also include that a case has been made by several communities that the company is harming them and whether or not the situation has been resolved to the communities’ satisfaction.</p>
  <p>For each COINs, the log holds facts, not judgements and each of us gets to decide what to do with them.</p>
