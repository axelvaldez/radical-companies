<h2>The Queen Is Dead</h2>
<p>
“What the f…?”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Ping DIED!”
</p>
<p>
“Really? What hap…”
</p>
<p>
“PING FELL DOWN A PRECIPICE!”
</p>
<p>
Humanity held its breath for a moment.
</p>
<p>
And then the infighting began.
</p>

<h2>Bloodshed</h2>
<p>
The Authority came apart more swiftly than anybody had expected. It seemed that
the Chairwoman’s inner circle knew that she was ill and they had been sharpening
their swords for a while now. But the suddenness of her accident was a shock
even to them.
</p>
<p>
Her transport had fallen over a precipice. That kind of accident was
impossible—it didn’t make sense. All transports had built-in technology to sense
whether or not the ground ahead was capable of holding its weight. That’s why
roads had fallen into disrepair and nearly disappeared. Rumor had it that
Chairwoman Ping’s transports could even over really big drops, but the void
where she fell to her death was much deeper than that. The whole thing smelled
of sabotage but it was never proven conclusive.
</p>
<p>
After the initial shock, Ping’s inner ring acted quickly and when it was all
said and done a lot of blood had flowed. The would-be-kings were left bossing
over very small enclaves, wasting their energies on fighting each other. At the
same time, the old RADICAL Pods reactivated more quickly than any of them had
expected, and they were better integrated than ever, including the space
habitats.
</p>
<p>
This time, however, they were able to protect themselves. They prevented a lot
of fighting by redirecting the authoritarian troops away from each other.
Sometimes they used their technology to confuse their dispatches and sometimes
it was done by RADICAL Marine officers. This gave soldiers the opportunity to
desert, and, as it so happened, the RADICALS were waiting to onboard them. The
few soldiers who tried to subvert the RADICAL recovery operation were rebuffed
by the ones who were sick of the violence and were ready to try a new way of
living.
</p>

<h2>Hard-Learned Wisdom</h2>
<p>
Besides welcoming AWOL soldiers into RADICAL life, the Pods made a concerted
effort to not let FIAT enclaves fester as they had in the past. This time they
actively helped people integrate into the RADICAL communities.
</p>
<p>
This time people had lived under Earth Authority rule and reality. They had the
scars that many years of authoritarian, and oftentimes brutal domination left
imprinted in their minds and bodies. They knew that they had to actively help
people learn to become fully functional and responsible adults and to recognize
what was healthier for them. They knew, now more than ever, that people had to
get there themselves. They had to create their own meaning and find their
communities at their own pace.
</p>
<p>
This time the RADICALS were ready to actively help make that possible.
</p>
