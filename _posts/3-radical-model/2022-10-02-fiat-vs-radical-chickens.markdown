<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>The lonely hero is a myth. Achievements are the result of people working together in communities, the people I touch and those who touch me. As Purdue biologist William Muir discovered, it takes a team to impact productivity.</p>
 <p>As an experiment, Dr Muier first bred only very productive super-chickens and found that, <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; only three of the team survived as the group pecked each other to death.</span><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> They were the highest egg-laying producers only because of fatal force. Needless to say, the super-chicken coop productivity went down.</p>
 <p>Then he bred the most prodigious egg-laying chicken <em>coop</em>, teams, and egg productivity increased for the whole coop without fatalities. It turns out that the whole community, and not super-chickens, are the key to increased egg productivity.</p>
