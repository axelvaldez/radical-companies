 <p><span class="_quotespan">How can I talk about <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span>s to people who don&rsquo;t know anything about it?</span> What are its Principles? Does <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> have a structure?</p>
 <p>Note that principles and structure are a reflection of <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> concerns, and these questions really are about centralization and would translate to who defines these principles and structures? Who is the boss?</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, you can address these types of questions by talking about the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> tools you do have,</p>
 <ul style="margin-left:20px; ">
  <li>The RADs! mobile app<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></li>
  <li>The Agreements<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></li>
  <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> Foundations</li>
 </ul>
 <p>You can read about the first two in previous posts. This post is about the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> Foundations.</p>

<h1>Radical Foundation Template</h1>
 <p>Our deepest problems are the inescapable side-effects of the system we live in: our collapsing climate, the expanding wealth, and wellbeing, gap, discrimination against people of color, the exploitation of women. Instead, we need a generative way of relating to one another, a different paradigm. As we see it, businesses are the place to start. Businesses-as-dictatorship are the root of the problem, so they must be the incubators for what comes next.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model, a <em>company</em> is simply a group of people who come together to build something bigger than themselves. The word "company" comes from the Latin prefix con-, meaning together, and pan, meaning bread. A company then is a group of people who work and socialize together.</p>
 <p>Every company is different because the people who embody it are different. What fundamentally makes a <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> company different from a <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> business is that it starts from this simple Foundation.</p>
