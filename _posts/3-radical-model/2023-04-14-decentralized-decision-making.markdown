<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Imagine that a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> company uses <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span>s to propose a project. The <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> includes its description including the skills and resources they might need. After a period of giving it shape, the <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> is funded.</p>

<h1>First Team, First Failure</h1>
 <p>As a decentralized company, everybody participates in strategizing. That is generally a good thing, but, in this case, people can&rsquo;t agree on what strategy to take. Even though these people are co-owners, they are frozen and can&rsquo;t take the next step.</p>
 <p>It could be because these people have lived their whole life in an environment. Not used to making decisions, they would act this way.</p>

<h1>Another Team, Another Failure</h1>
 <p>Then another team would take over after figuring out that something must be done differently. So they <em>elect</em> a <em>chief strategist</em> and commit to following whatever decision their chief strategist comes up with.</p>
 <p>Again, they fail to meet expectations, too. Perhaps the chief strategist didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing but having drunk from the power cup, he could not put it down.</p>

<h1>Yet Another Team and&hellip; Success!</h1>
 <p>Then another team takes over. This time they talk among themselves only to discover that there are at least two people that they should listen to. You wouldn&rsquo;t know unless you ask, but, as part of their conversation, they asked!</p>
  <ul>
   <li>They then run through an <em>Explicit Relationship</em>.</li>
   <li>They come up with an <em>Explicit Alignment</em>.</li>
   <li>The two strategists are not that far apart and end up working as a team, with everybody&rsquo;s support and participation.</li>
   <li>This time, the project meets expectations.</li>
  </ul>
 
 <h1>And Now&hellip;</h1>
  <p>Now that you have read this, don&rsquo;t wait until this happens to you, make it part of a workshop that would-be <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>s have available to them.</p>
  <p>Help people <em>learn</em> and <em>grow</em>.</p>
