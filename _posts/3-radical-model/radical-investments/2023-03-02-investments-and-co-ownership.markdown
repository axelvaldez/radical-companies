 <p>Investments could be completely or partially funded with <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s yield,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Put up a <span class="_paradigm">Banner</span>.</li>
   <li>People pledge a number of their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to the <span class="_paradigm">Banner</span>.</li>
   <li>If it falls short from the amount specified in the <span class="_paradigm">Banner</span><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>, you will need an outside investment.</li>
   <li>If you have consent, you can get an outside <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> investment for the difference.</li>
   <li>Done.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Reminders</h1>
 <ul>
  <li><span class="_paradigm">Banner</span>s can&rsquo;t give <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s back, so this process cannot be gamed or corrupted (at least, not this way).</li>
  <li>An internal investment can come from anybody with company <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, including people for the ensemble your company may be part of.</li>
  <li>Consensus means that everybody has to agree without a doubt. If you don&rsquo;t, we badger you or bribe you until you are willing to say you agree. If nothing works, the whole process stops. You are at the mercy of one.</li>
  <li>Consent means that you are not sure you fully agree, but you can live with it. Alternatively, the disagreeing people have to explain their reason. It is an opportunity for all to learn.</li>
  <li>For internal investments, the <em>consent</em> <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s get taken out of the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s given in this cycle and contributed to the <span class="_paradigm">Banner</span>s. Pledging co-owners get a percentage ownership according to the number of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s they pledge.</li>
 </ul>
