 <p>The question came up again: Why not call a business a <span class="_paradigm">Business</span>? or a <span class="_paradigm">Firm</span>? Why the insistence on <span class="_paradigm">Company</span>?</p>

<h1>Businesses and Firms</h1>
 <p>The sole purpose of a <em>business</em> is to make money for the owners. In <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based companies, we want to make money for everybody involved, but it is not the reason for coming together.</p>
 <p>A <em>firm</em>, too, is about making money for the owners. It might have meant something else in the past, but it implies power and rigidness today.</p>

<h1>Companies</h1>
 <p>A <span class="_paradigm">company</span> is about people and about making a positive impact. It is about people coming together to accomplish something bigger than any one person can. A <span class="_paradigm">company</span> is <em>fluid</em> and <em>dynamic</em>. And, of course, they have to make money, too.</p>

<h1>A Story</h1>
 <p>The word &ldquo;company&rdquo; comes from the Latin prefix <em>con-</em> (together) and <em>pan</em> (bread). It means people who break bread together. We could have made up a word, but we did not want to sound too alien. The word &ldquo;company,&rdquo; on the other hand, is familiar and it has this lovely origin.</p>
