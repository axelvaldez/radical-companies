<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Ownership is enclosures, a human invention, and fundamental to the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model.</p>
</div>

<div class="_citation">
 I have, therefore I am.<br>
 And the more I have, the more I am.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>
</div>

<h1>Ownership</h1>
 <p>As I see it, ownership is,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The result of enclosures brought about by robbery, mostly violent (<em>i.e.</em>, Marxists rejoice).</li>
   <li>The best ever human invention (<em>i.e.</em>, Neoliberals rejoice).</li>
   <li>Fundamental to the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model (<em>i.e.</em>, everybody is puzzled).</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Attachment</h1>
 <p>In <em>Fun Facts about Ownership</em>, <em>Science of Ownership</em> magazine says, <span class="_quotespan">Awareness of ownership rights already emerges in children as young as 2 or 3 years.</span><a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> But that is careless nonsense. Our brains come wired for <em>attachment</em>, but not ownership</p>
 <p>We learn ownership from those around us, <span class="_quotespan">As children get older, they gain social skills and learn to negotiate conflicts on their own.</span><a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<div class="_citation">
 Ownership followed &hellip; possession.<a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>
</div>
<h1>Possession</h1>
 <p>The process of legitimizing lang-grabs is still going on, although these days is more about things like,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Forever <em>copyrights</em></li>
   <li>Never-ending <em>patents</em></li>
   <li><em>Digital data</em> about you! (<em>i.e.</em>, businesses like Facebook and Google use that information to their heart&rsquo;s content without asking you)</li>
  </ul>

<h1 id="_minemine">MINE! MINE!</h1>
 <p>Anything a toddler comes in contact with is &ldquo;MINE! MINE!&rdquo;. It likely has to do with the fact that,
  <ul>
   <li>Anything and everything we come in contact with, and doesn&rsquo;t harm us, can, according to our brains,<a href="#en05"><sup id="bm05">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> extend our bodies and it appropriates it easily and swiftly (<em>i.e.</em>, unconsciously).</li>
   <li>And, of course, anything that is part of our body cannot be let go just like that.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>It all goes to say that possession is a very real, intrinsic thing and we should not pretend otherwise. We tried believing that &ldquo;a new man&rdquo;<a href="#en06"><sup id="bm06">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> would rise who would not be attached to possessions. However, that&rsquo;s not the way it went. Not at all.</p>
 <p>What about the farming-led-to-ownership story? Well, let&rsquo;s just say that it is just a story, and not very convincing. In any case, none of us were there and we are all guessing. These days, it makes more sense to me that the whole possession-to-ownership thing had more to do with the invention of coinage,<a href="#en07"><sup id="bm07">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> another grand human invention.</p>

<h1>Going Forward</h1>
 <p>What happened in the past cannot be changed or fixed in the present. What counts is what we do <em>going forward</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, and preferably, what we do to make sure that long-term errors of the past <em>do not</em> persist).</p>
 <p>We have to make things work for everybody, not just a subset of humanity. If ownership is a good thing, then let&rsquo;s make it work for everybody. We can do it in a steady-eddy, gradual way, without violence.</p>
 <p>And <em>that</em> is what <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> Distributions are about: A tool for revolutionaries (without explosives).</p>
