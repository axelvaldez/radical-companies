 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> molecule is made up of the recently discovered atoms: Foundation, PRI, Explicit Alignment, The <em>RADs!</em> mobile app, and Explicit Relationships. That is it, so far.</p>

 <p>The <em>Radicalium</em> molecule is made up of the  of the recently discovered atoms,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Foundanium</strong>; The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> Foundation.</li>
   <li><strong>Alignium</strong>: Generated by <em>Explicit Alignment</em>.</li>
   <li><strong>RADsidum</strong>: Generated by the fission-powered <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s! mobile app</em>.</li>
   <li><strong>Trustagreedium</strong>: Generated by <em>Explicit Relationships</em>.</li>
   <li><strong>PRInium</strong>: Defined by each individual co-owner, the Predictable Recurring Income replaces <em>fixed wages</em>.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>RADsidum</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s determine your level of co-ownership dynamically. These <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are generated by the fission-powered <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s! mobile app</em> which makes it easier for co-owners to recognize contributions made by other co-owners.</p>

<h1>Trustagreedium</h1>
 <p>An <span class='_paradigm'>Explicit Relationship</span> is a guide to an exploration among co-owners to make sure that 1) they can get get aligned and 2) they want to work with each other. Even if this is somebody you know very well, do not skip going through the <span class='_paradigm'>Explicit Relationship</span>. It may turned out to be perfectly boring or you may discover surprises along the way.</p>

<h1>PRInium</h1>
 <p>You may not need a <span class='_paradigm'>Predictable Recurring Income</span> fund, but if you do, fund it with a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical Investment</span>.</p>
 <p>We developed PRInium because anything like <em>shares</em> in the business gives away power over decision-making and will likely become an obstacle to your business. Keep taking PRInium</p>

<h1>The Molecule</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">Radicalium</span>, the <span class="_paradigm">Radical Molecule</span>, and it elements have potential beyond our wildest dreams. Our Lab will continue to work on it.</p>
