 <p>&ldquo;Certificates&rdquo; fit in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world we live in, run by hierarchies and organized around domination through fear. But &ldquo;certs&rdquo; don&rsquo;t make sense within a RADICAL system, without hierachies or domination."</p>
</div>

<h1>How It Started</h1>
 <p>The issue of &ldquo;certification&rdquo; came up as: <span class='_paradigm'>it&rsquo;d be nice to have a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> cert.</span> Certification makes sense in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, run by hierarchies and organized around domination through fear, <em>a mighty authority certifies that you are qualified</em>. On the other hand, &ldquo;certs&rdquo; are incongruous with a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model, without hierarchies, domination, or fear posing as &ldquo;motivation.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Given that we live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world, and will do so for a while, the urge for differentiation is not unreasonable: &ldquo;<em>Hey, we are certified as <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>!</em>&rdquo; However, rather than an external authority, the <em>people</em> who embody a company <em>are</em> the ones to positively declare that, <span class='_quotespan'>We are on a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> path, and here&rsquo;s the data that tells where we are at along the path</span>
 
<h1>Not Aligned</h1>
 <p>&ldquo;Certs&rdquo; are incongruent with the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model because they are issued by external authorities brought in as an authority to the certs&rsquo;s rules.</p>
 <p>For example, the <em>Great Place to Work&trade; Institute</em> has become a &ldquo;culture authority.&rdquo; Early on it was very good at getting brand name clients like Forbes and other business wanted to be certified by <span class=''>the same people who certified Forbes</span>. They issue a survey, collect responses from employees, and then return to the bosses their score broken down by categories. The survey and its categories are not very scientific or methodological, but it is practical enough to convince people who value the cert more than the data. They want the bragging rights. &ldquo;Higher&rdquo; is not &ldquo;better,&rdquo;.</p>
 <p>Another example is <em>B Labs</em> which has become a &ldquo;environmental impact authority&rdquo; with its &ldquo;B Corp certificate.&rdquo; They investigate, quantify, and corroborate any and all claims that the bosses may make. But bosses are very good at obfuscating things and while many companies have deeply ingrained values that happened to be aligned to the ones that B Corp claims, most others use their <em>B Certs</em> for virtue signaling and bragging rights.<sup id="bn01"><a href="#fn01">1&nbsp;</a></sup></p>
 
<h1>Nonetheless</h1>
 <p>In our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world, it makes sense to have external <em>authorities</em> investigate that management is not lying or are pressuring their employees to &lsquo;be positive.&rdquo; The resulting <em>certificate</em> and their ranking make the service easier to sell to the bosses.</p>
 <p>By contrast, in the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model, a company&rsquo;s co-owners, backed by fully transparent data, are the ultimate authority in declaring what path they&rsquo;re on based on what they live day and day out.</p>

<h1>To Protect Employees</h1>
 <p>The result of these surveys are redacted, &ldquo;<em>for the privacy and safety of employees</em>.&rdquo; But that excuse does not apply in the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model since there are no employees who can be fired for voicing their feelings or pointing out what needs fixing. <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> co-owners don&rsquo;t need &ldquo;protection&rdquo; from hearing what others have to say. In fact, because the data is fully transparent, the same is true for the community outside the company: anybody can look at the detail, ask questions, comment on conclusions, and, ultimately, learn.</p>
 <p>And, yes, all co-owners can agree to lie and put out false data. That is very unlikely, however, and would eventually come out.</p>

<h1>What Is the Alternative?</h1>
 <p>Surveys are fine for collecting data relatively quickly, but they need to have a foundation. The <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> Foundation has only five to remember,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <table class="_h2table">
    <tr>
     <th>people</th>
     <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>commitments</th>
     <td>Decentralization & Transparency</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>practices</th>
     <td>Experimentation</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </div>
 <p>Questions based on this Foundation gives companies, and anybody else who cares to look, a view of how the company is doing, what needs to change/improve, etc. <span class='_quotespan'>Is the company more decentralized or less?</span>.</p>
