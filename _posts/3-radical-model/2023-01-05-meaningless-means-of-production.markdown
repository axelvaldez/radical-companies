<div style="display:none;">
 <p>It used to be that the bad guys were the owners of <em>the means of production</em>, but that is not the problem. Not today.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>For Karl Marx, the bad guys were the owners of <em>the means of production</em>. &ldquo;The means of production&rdquo; has not ever been the deep problem and it certainly is not today.</p>
 <p>There were bad guys and they did a lot of obvious harm, but beneath all this bad stuff, there was a system that rewarded their <em>competitive and dominant</em> behavior. It is still going on today, but with a nicer face.</p>
 <p>In fact, it has been nameless, but we now call it the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system. Capitalism is a child of <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>.</p>
 <p>What went out with the bathwater is <em>dignity</em>. We confuse status for dignity and attaboys for <em>recognition</em>.</p>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span>-based model,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Your <em>peers</em> recognize your contributions.</li>
  <li>Your contributions are made tangible.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>The RADs! Mobile App</h1>
 <p>This is exactly what the <em>RADs!</em> app does,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <table class="_h2table">
    <tr>
     <th>Recognized Contributions</th>
     <td>
      <p>It lets everybody recognize what they see as your contributions. You may even be surprised by what others see as near superhero behavior. They can do this fairly and efficiently because they are working side by side with you.</p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Conversions</th>
     <td>The app converts these recognized contributions to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Tangible</th>
     <td><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s determine your percentage of whatever is being distributed, more likely dividends.</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </div>
