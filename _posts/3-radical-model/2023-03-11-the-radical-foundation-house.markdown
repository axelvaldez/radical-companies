 <p>Discomfort is good for you. Not pleasant, especially at the moment, but good.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Yesterday we had a discussion about a way of reframing the <span class='_quotespan'><span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model</span>. After having slept over it, I woke up with an image of a building where,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <div class='_center'>
     <img
      src='/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-1.svg'
      alt='The floor of the Foundation house, it shows the words MEANING and BELONGING as its two axis.'
      style='width:70%; '
     >
    </div>
    The words <span class='_paradigm'>Meaning</span> and <span class='_paradigm'>Belonging</span> are the two axes of the &ldquo;ground floor&rdquo; (actually, I had them as the top floor, but Jose called the &ldquo;ground floor&rdquo;). It represents the people fundamentals,
   </li>
   <li>
    <div class='_center'>
     <img
      src='/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-2.svg'
      alt='The roof of the Foundation house, it shows the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY as its two axis.'
      style='width:70%; '
     >
    </div>
    <span class='_paradigm'>Decentralization</span> and <span class='_paradigm'>Transparenccy</span> are the axis of the &ldquo;roof&rdquo; meaning that 1) the house has no boss in it and 2) everything is transparent. By having all information available to everybody, it makes sure that any potential &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; of the system is apparent to everybody and it gets dealt with.
   </li>
   <li>
    <div class='_center'>
     <img
      src='/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-3.svg'
      alt='The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between the floor and the roof and holds up the house.'
      style='height:3.33in; '
     >
    </div>
    Finally, <span class='_paradigm'>Eexperimentation</span>, underlying all practices, holds up the house. This means that that whether an experiment worked as you expected it or not, you always learn from it. Knowledge holds up the house.
   </li>
  </ul>

<h1>Altogether Now</h1>
 <p>Altogether, they make up the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical Foundation</span> house,</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <img
    width='70%'
    src='/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-4.svg'
    alt='The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom. The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between them.' 
    width='70%'
   >
  </div>

<h1>Explicit Alignment</h1>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Explicit Alignment</span> goes <em>inside</em> each house, depicted here as floors between the ground floor and to the roof.</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <img
    src='/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-5.svg'
    alt='The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom. The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between them. Also in between roof and floor, Explicit Alignment are the three floors between roof and floor.'

  </div>
  <ul>
   <li>There is one <span class='_paradigm'>Impact</span>. Changing the impact is major: it is the equivalent of making up a new company.</li>
   <li>There is one <span class='_paradigm'>Purpose</span>, although it may change (the gray translucent color under <span class='_paradigm'>Purpose</span> represents a past <span class='_paradigm'>Purpose</span>).</li>
   <li>There are many <span class='_paradigm'>Missions,</span> one after another and many in parallel.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Everything else is a Practice,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Practices change from company to company.</li>
   <li>They change over time.</li>
   <li>They are not integral to the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Examples of practices,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The <em><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s! mobile app</em>.</li>
   <li><span class='_paradigm'>Explicit Relationships</span>.</li>
   <li>Parboiled legal structure.</li>
   <li>etc.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Many Houses</h1>
 <p>What the uncomfortable discussion made me see is that there may be many houses, some of them based on the template model. The important thing is the effect it has on people&rsquo;s lives and on our world.</p>

<h1>A Template House</h1>
 <p>For example, a template house would be like this,</p>
 <div class='_center'>
  <img
   src='/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-7.svg'
   alt='The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top, the roof, and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom, the ground floor. The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between them. Between roof and floor, there are three floors labeled IMPACT, PURPOSE, and MISSION, as before, but this time with list of specific PRACTICES attached to each.'

 </div>

<h1>A Framing</h1>
 <p>Our intention is that this &ldquo;framing&rdquo; of the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model be appealing enough to build specific houses where what changes is the inside stuff, but not its floor, columns, or roof.</p>
