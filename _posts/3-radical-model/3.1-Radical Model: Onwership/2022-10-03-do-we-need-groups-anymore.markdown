<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>I am starting to wonder whether we need groups at all anymore. What if <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> income just came from personal rather than corporate income? I am also really tempted to start calling groups of <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> people Conviviums, a word that I got from one of the <em>Capital as Power</em> papers.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>So I&rsquo;m going to try and flesh out this idea of payment. I think of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s as being able to reward the giants on whose shoulders I have stood and the people I am in community with. And solely that.</p>

<h1>Ads and Sponsorships</h1>
 <p>For example, I have a YouTube channel where I publish videos of my 3D Printing projects. I also have a Patreon account. And I start a Discord chat that centers around my inventing activities. All my Patreon sponsors get invited to the chat.</p>
 <p>Altogether, I generate revenue from,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>YouTube Ads</li>
  <li>Patreon sponsorship</li>
 </ul>
 <p>I invite everyone who provides YouTube feedback to a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community and I also invite Patreon sponsors who provide valuable feedback about my videos. Their contributions inspire me and I want to reward them. Everyone in the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community is recognized, by me and everyone else, for their contributions. As a result, they get <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. And everyone with <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s shares the dividends from the YouTube revenue.</p>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s say I make $5K in dividends and I distribute $2.5K of it through the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> Community according to the allocations (<em>i.e.</em>, which everyone can see). The actual money can be distributed through Venmo, CashApp, or Zelle.</p>
 
<h1>Patreon Sponsorships</h1> 
 <p>In the case of my Patreon sponsorships, I know that what I am doing is thanks to 1) the people who build, maintain, and promote YouTube, 2) youtubers who normalized publishing videos for a living, and 3) many others that made YouTube what it is today. However, they already got compensated for their contributions to bring it to this point and I don't feel an obligation to compensate them further (<em>i.e.</em>, YouTube already takes a big chunk of the Ad revenue).</p>
 <p>However, maybe the sponsors who comment on my videos should benefit from the overall Patreon dividends, too. I could create a separate <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community to share that revenue according to their contributions. Or I could lump the Ad revenue and the sponsorships and add the sponsors to the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community. That sounds like interesting experiments.</p>

<h1>Confidential and Attractive</h1>
 <p>Suppose that someone says, &ldquo;You look so confident and attractive,&rdquo; in response to one of my YouTube videos. That night, riding high on the compliment, my partner and I make beautiful love and we made that night all the sweeter. Feeling inspired by the compliment and the love making, I come up with an invention, patent it, and I become a billionaire. Shouldn&rsquo;t the complimenter get to share in my windfall? She would if I had recognized her contribution and had given her <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s in an <em>Invention <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> community</em></p>
 <p>There is no &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answer, it is not at all clear. We don&rsquo;t claim that we can cleanse ourselves from the  mindset and it will take us all a long time to shake off those habits.</p>
 <p>It seems that in this case,
  <ul>
   <li>I share some of my revenue with the group because they are actively contributing to what I do in YouTube</li>
   <li>On the other hand, I am not sharing my Patreon income because it feels that that comes as a result of my individual effort.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>The Pump Convivium</h1>
 <p>A group of people gets together as a <em>convivium</em> to make pumps. I make the impeller. A woman, one my my peer co-owners, makes the housings. And a nonbinary person sells the pumps. Other companies is happy with the pumps and pays for them.</p>
 <p>In this case, the revenue happens because of the work we all do. None of us could build pumps at the same rate and quality by ourselves.</p>
 <p>The dividends are distributed according to the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s co-owners gave each other through the pump building process. <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s are based on our recognized contributions.</p>

<h1>So&hellip;</h1>
 <p>We need groups. </p>
