 <p>Intelligence is what the PFC reports to us as conscious throught; competence is how we digest food, go to the bathroom, etc. We don&rsquo;t know how we do it, it just happens.</p>

 <p>Blair Fix makes an excellent post in his latest post: competence is not intelligence.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Intelligence is what the Pre-Frontal Cortex (PFC) reports as conscious thought. Competance is things like how we digest food, go to the bathroom, etc. We don&rsquo;t know how we do it, it just happens. Even if you theorize that we will know one day, we have been doing without knowing how it happens A LOT longer.</p>
 <p>It isn&rsquo;t Artificial Intelligence that is going to <span class='_quotespan'>eliminate humaniity.</span> The high risk for us is the enclosures of Artificial Competence tools.</p>
 <p>If the Musks and Altmans of this world have it their way, their businesses will among the handful who will be allowed to build Articial Competence tools. Smaller companies will have to take a lot of <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> investment to get over the regulatory hump or stay out of that business altogether.</p>
 <p>Open Source Software (OSS) wil be out of it for good.</p>
 </p>These enclosures are real risk. And it is not the fact that they will be making more money our ot it, but that by virtue of their capital investements they will getting more power to do their own &ldquo;regulation.&rdquo; of a technology with so much potential.</p>
 <p>A few poeple will be slotted into the priviledged category of &ldquo;AI wizards&rdquo; or some such and be paid a lot, but, still, what the bosses deem &ldquo;reasonable.&rdquo; Everybody else will live off handouts from the 21c Robber Barons that will bitterly complaint about. This means that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and the oligarchic owners will continue to thrive and the possibility of non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> systems and co-ownership will be very much slowed down.</p>
 <p>The title of Blair Fix is entitled, <span class='_quotespan'>No, AI Does Not Pose an Existential Risk to Humanity</span> is very true. ALso, very true is that the 21c Robbert Barons are pushing that idea hard an angling for a regulation moat around their businesses.</p>
