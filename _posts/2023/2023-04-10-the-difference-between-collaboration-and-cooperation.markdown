 <p>Collaboration and cooperation are close, but not the same.</p></p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Collaboration and cooperation are close, but not the same. They are both about <em>working with others to create bigger things</em>, but,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Cooperation aims <em>to achieve your <em>private</em> goals</em>.</li>
   <li>Collaboration aims <em>to achieve <em>shared</em> goals</em>.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Cooperation is what the <span class='_paragigm'>Fiat</span> ownership imposes. Collaboration is what we do by our contribution; it has made us people.</p>
