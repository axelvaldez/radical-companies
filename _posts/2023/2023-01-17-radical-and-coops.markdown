<h1>Radical Co-Ops</h1>
 <p>Co-ops people could easily switch to be based on the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model.</p>
 <p>It&rsquo;d be fairly straightforward to do by breaking the &ldquo;one person, one vote&rdquo; rule. They could then switch to a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s-based to a system based on contributions, not equality.</p>
 <p>Ideally, the whole co-op makes the switch, but most likely it will be be up to individual co-op members,</p> 
 <ul>
  <li>You could give your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s yield to a <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span>. For example, if somebody puts up a <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> to clean and beautify a nearby river walk, you could give the yield of some of your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to it.</li>
  <li>When somebody leaves the co-op, they take their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s with them. They earned them. So, they continue to get whatever is factored through these <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. However, they don&rsquo;t receive any new ones.</li>
  <li>Co-ops generally are managed by a <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> hierarchy. It still carries the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> presumption that &ldquo;the little people&rdquo; need a boss to tell them what to do. That would be one impediment to switching.</li>
  <li>Another impediment would be not wanting to change. But this evolves over time, so we are not worried about it.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Radical Co-Ops, the other Way</h1>
 <p>On the other hand, Radical-based companies could operate as co-ops. The &ldquo;excess&rdquo; <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span> yields could be put in an account, so that everybody would get the same take-home pay.</p>
 <p>Not sure what you would do with the excess amount. It might even lead people to not contribute.</p>
 <p>On second thought, I don&rsquo;t think this would last long, but it might be worth the experiment for some people.</p>
