 <p>We have to get away from capital as power to contributions as value as the basis of our culture. Not everybody has accumulated capital, but everybody can make contributions recognized by peers, not a boss or bureaucratic rules.</p>
 <p>We can then move from today&rsquo;s capital-based ownership to contribution-based co-ownership, share in the wealth we create, and have adults act like adults.</p>
