<div style="display:none;">
  <p>Connecting, Talking, Playing, A Healthy Home, and Community: all good for the mental health of children and the adults they become.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>In the words of Molly Wright,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
  <ul>
   <li>Connecting</li>
   <li>Talking</li>
   <li>Playing</li>
   <li>A Healthy Home</li>
   <li>Community</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is what makes for mentally healthy children.</p>
  <p>I would say that it also applies to any healthy communities.</p>
