 <p>If our culture and civilization, the Anthropocene, is to have a future, we need to rekindle our relationship with ourselves and our communities, to assure the survival of Earth, our life support.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>If culture and civilization, the Anthropocene , is to have a future we need to embrace this critical moment in our relationship with ourselves, our communities, and planet to ensure its survival.</p>
 <p>We no longer deny that we have had a dramatic and significantly negative impact on the environment, our life-support system. If we want our discoveries and progress to survive, we must take steps to ensure its survival. We must question every single layer of the fabric of our &ldquo;normal&rdquo; way of doing things, our  ways.</p>

<h1>Ownership</h1>
 <p>In particular, we need a dramatic change in the way we understand ownership. What we are used to, the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</spam> way, is to view ownership as a given: a few special people are owners and everybody else works for them to make a living. Things have been getting better and have progressed so that must be a sign that the system is working for us all and that has been the end of the discussion. In fact, that assumption is leading us to a disastrous fall over the proverbial cliff.</p>
 <p>Ownership is a human invention and a very good one at that. Owners care for their property, etc. I am not sure if that is &ldquo;in our nature&rdquo; or that is the way that it has worked out, but, in any case, let’s go with that assumption.</p>

<h1>Assumption: Ownership Is Good</h1>
 <p>As a good thing then, ownership should be spread out to <em>everybody</em>, not just a selected few. It doesn&rsquo;t really work well when limited to a very small segment of people. Competition and domination has pushed us to put the financial system as the ultimate boss, with society as a servant and it will do it again and again.</p>
 <p>Ownership does not work well for society when in the hands of a selected few, let&rsquo;s try spreading it to everybody and see what happens. People will do a lot of things, but they won't destroy their life support system.</p>

<h1>Employment</h1>
 <p>Employment is the descendants of slavery. I am not even being bombastic.</p>
 <p>People that are no longer the exclusive property of a slaver. Instead, they get to sell their labor capacity to the highest bidder. Now we can go from employer to employer to &ldquo;improve our lot.&rdquo; People <em>have to</em> sell themselves, as employees or gig workers.</p>
 <p>Musk, Bezos, etc., don&rsquo;t have to. Like other owners, they don&rsquo;t <em>have to</em> work for a living. They live off other people&rsquo;s work.</p>

<h1>Amazon</h1>
 <p>Since we mentioned him, let&rsquo;s look at Jeff Bezos. At the start he really worked hard, took a huge risk on the Internet, changed the way publishers did business, and, in spite of “Wall Street” demands to the contrary, he invested re-invested profits in Amazon for a long time and built a hardware business and created the Cloud space. Amazon became the big kahuna and Bezos one of the wealthiest owners in the world.</p>
 <p>Besides MacKensie Scot, his then wife, he was supported by the original investment his parents made. They had accumulated $300,000 in their retirement fund and gave it all to Jeff to get started. They didn&rsquo;t rob anybody to get that money: his father went to school, became an engineer, and that skill got him a middle class pay and generous benefits; his mom supported both of them with her work and tenacity.</p>
 <p>But then, Amazon followed the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; business path. The business paid its workers salaries and kept profits for the owners. Ownership worked great for Jeff Bezos and Amazon&rsquo;s investors. Many of its employees did very well, too, but not as well as Jeff Bezos. “But he did much more&hellip; ” I hear you thinking, “&hellip; and the people who worked for Amazon had it safe and cozy.” Or they had to pee in a bottle. Even the ones who didn&rsquo;t have to pee in a bottle, didn&rsquo;t benefit from the growth that they helped create.</p>

<h1>Experiment: Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Ownership worked great for Jeff Bezos and it would have worked just as great for everyone who helped create that wealth.</p>
 <p>However, co-ownership takes a huge mindset change. First, we have to see the invisible: ownership is not a given, it is not sacred. It is a human invention, and it is good. If it has caused progress to happen all these centuries, imagine what it would do if <em>everybody</em> was an owner. Co-owners care for their property. Co-owners would own their creation. Co-owners will take care of their life support system, not use it as a garbage can while saying &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what Government is for, to clean up!&rdquo;</p>
 <p>We need a system that will eventually lead to universal co-ownership. Near as I can tell, this is the only path to saving, and going beyond, the Anthropocene.</p>
