<h1>Gravity</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Gravy is a force.</li>
  <li>Gravity is good. But force is bad.</li>
  <li>Gravity forces things (like us) to be aligned with the center of massive objects (like the Earth).
  <li>Without gravity there’d be no life.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Once Again</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>A big person forces a small person against the ground.</li>
  <li>The big guy is doing a bad thing.</li>
  <li>But gravity is forcing both the big and small guy to the ground, the only difference is one is on his own legs, the other is not.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Maybe…</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>A tiger kills and lunches on a bamby-lie deer.</li>
  <li>That is bad for the deer, but good for the tiger.</li>
  <li>So, maybe some force is bad and some.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>So, People</h1>
 <p>Maybe force is bad when <em>people</em> apply it to other <em>people</em>.</p>

     <p>But, it is not OK to force people into the slaughterhouse.

    <td>It is OK for people to lust, eat unhealthily, want everything, lay around doing nothing, rage, envy, or show pride (<em>i.e.</em>, the seven deadly sins).</td>
    <td>
     <p>But it is not OK to force other people to do any of these things.</p>
     <p>That would be a <em>crime</em>.</p>

    <td>It is OK to force oxen to pull the plow.</td>
    <td>
     <p>But it is not OK to force people to pull the plow.</p>
     <p>That is called slavery and it is a <em>crime</em>.</p>
    </td>
   </tr>

 <p>The FIAT system forces non-owners to labor for sustenance, but that, interestingly, is the very opposite of a <em>crime</em>. It is even celebrated by most religions.</p>
