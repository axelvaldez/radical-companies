<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Collaboration and cooperation are close, but not the same. They are both about working with others, but,</p>
  <ul>
   <li class="_citation">Collaboration aims <em>to achieve shared goals</em>.</li>
   <li class="_citation">[C]ooperation aims <em>to achieve your own goals</em>.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Cooperation is that the <span class='_paragigm'>FIAT</span> owership imposes via capital. Collaboration is what people naturally do,  via contributions.</p>
