 <p>Instead of giving a deadline, give them a date for the next &ldquo;Status&rdquo; meeting.</p>
 <p>Say it is a Wednesday morning, instead of saying, <span class="_quotespan">it will take me two day,</span> say <span class="_quotespan">let&rsquo;s have a <em>Status</em> meeting on Friday at 4 pm.</span> At the status meeting, you might say that you expected to be done by then, <span class="_quotespan">but&hellip;</span></p>
