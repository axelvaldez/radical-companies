<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Instead of having &ldquo;meetings&rdquo; we are going to try having &ldquo;collaboration&rsquo; or &ldquo;coordination&rsquo; meetings. Of course, <span class="_quotespan">do not have a meeting unless you have an agenda,</span> but naming it makes it more to the point and it also limits the agenda.</p>
