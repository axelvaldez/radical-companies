<div style="display: none;">National fiat money is the problem, and so is our system of loans and investment. RADICAL COINs could a solution.</div>

<pre class="prettyprint" style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid CadetBlue; background-color: #FFFAF0; font-family: American Typewriter, serif; ">If Kings had figured out

<br>
<br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Today, money is the canonical medium of exchange and that is what we assumed in
our book, RADICAL COMPANIES.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1"
rel="footnote">1</a></sup> After all, we need money to pay our bills and as a
medium of exchange to buy stuff. Unfortunately, money also supports hoarding as
a way to accumulate financial wealth and power over everything, including
people. This is problematic and leads to the most serious problems we face
today.
</p>
<p>
For this and other reasons, I now believe that we should have a RADICAL COIN
that doesn’t have the baggage of national fiat money and can help us transform
our economy to be more human-centric.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2"
rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Like today’s money, COINs function as,
</p>
<ul>
<li>A unit of measure</li>
<li>Store of value</li>
<li>Medium of exchange</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, and this is critical, COINs are transparent in the sense that an
integral part of each COIN is its log of information from which potential risks
and benefits can be calculated.
</p>
<p>
COINs are also decentralized. Companies will be the guarantors of COINs. Not
banks. Not governments. Not international accords. This will make the costs of
all transactions negligible.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is that a decentralized and transparent COIN will make possible a
world-wide market that we can all play in without intermediaries.
</p>

<h2>Some Terminology</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
   <td style="vertical-align: text-top; border-right: black dotted 1px;"><strong>National Fiat Coin</strong></td>
   <td>Throughout the rest of this document, you will notice that I stubbornly
use “national fiat coin,” instead of “money” or “currency.” This is mostly to
remind myself of a few key distinctions,
   <ul>
     <li>“Money” is primarily a concept</li>
     <li>“Coins” are a tangible instance of money.</li>
     <li>“Fiat money” is coinage created by fiat, out of whole cloth. It used to be
that you needed gold to create coins, but not anymore.</li>
   </ul>
     <p>As a <em>unit of measure</em>, a national fiat coin works like a meter or a
minute and serves as a stable denominator for transactions. However, while the
meter and the minute are world-wide units, fiat coins are a national thing. This
makes them very unstable and fragile as a unit of measure (<em>e.g.</em>,
imagine a minute being “devalued” or something being measured in 仪表).<sup
id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
     <p>National fiat coins act as a <em>store of value</em> by virtue of their fixed
nominal value. This means that these coins can be used to accumulate financial
wealth. From that perspective, national fiat coins do not deserve to be called
“currency,” not while stuffed under the proverbial mattress.</p>
     <p>National fiat coins serve as a <em>medium of exchange</em>. This is the
prevailing message that governments, banks, and the whole financial industry
repeats over and over. At one point exchange was based on the value of gold, but
since the 1970s the system is based on each country’s say so, national fiat
coins.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> National
governments talk about this as the best thing since sliced bread, and
international accords have tried to cobble together a market out of them, but
the whole arrangement is very fragile and under constant threat.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="vertical-align: text-top; border-right: black dotted 1px;"><strong>Currency</strong></td>
   <td><p>Another common name for national fiat coins is “currency.” It means to indicate that <em>money flows</em> from one person to the next to facilitate the exchange of commodities. But national fiat coins don’t always <em>flow</em>. Because these coins hold their value forever, they can be hoarded to accumulate financial wealth in bank accounts or under the proverbial mattress.</p>
   <p>Given this, national fiat coins do not deserve to be called “currency.”</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>To avoid confusion, I use “money” to refer to the concept, “national fiat coin”
to refer to what we normally mean by money, and “currency” not at all.</p>

<h2>Historical Perspective</h2>
<p>
COINs are not to be confused, or conflated, with local or complementary
currencies, demurrage money, or any such.<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5"
rel="footnote">5</a></sup> Ditto for Mutualism, Marxism, or any other theory or
ideology. The point of COIN is to make it possible to have a market, free of
intermediaries, and with negligible costs.
</p>
<p>
In fact, although they are not identical, COINs are very similar to national
fiat coins. They are a unit of measure, a store of value, and a medium of
exchange, but with these twists,
</p>
<ol>
  <li>They represent value at its broadest. In addition to financial value, they account for wellbeing, contributions, acts of kindness, and all the other things that are important to people.</li>
  <li>They spread risks and benefits through society. We all share in the adventure: the burden of risk and the joys of gains.</li>
  <li>
    COINs bypass the complications and costs brought about by banks, exchanges, national politics,<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> and the influence of transnationals.<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>
    <p>COINs have the potential to enable a world-wide market. This will help us break out of our national silos, create an economy that’s decentralized and transparent.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Worth Repeating</h2>
<p>
This may be a difficult read and it may be worth repeating here a few words
about the RADICAL framework and how it’s different from our current world.
Probably the most confusing thing about it is that a RADICAL world would be very
similar to our current world. People will be the same with all our jealousies,
overreactions, and habits. They will be embarrassed by overpromising and want to
sweep under the proverbial rug.
</p>
<p>
The only difference—the big difference—is that the RADICAL system is centered
around our interdependence.
</p>
<p>
Our current system is based on separating us: countries, towns, good and bad
neighborhoods; political parties and their vastly different realities; need to
know, secrecy, protection. This leaves us disconnected and drives us to
isolation. Businesses are built on creating platforms to bring us back together,
for a fee. This works for a world where money comes first, ahead of everything
else.
</p>
<p>
A RADICAL world, too, is centered around accomplishments and real innovation,
but it prioritizes what’s important to people first, ahead of everything else,
including money. We’ll still be individuals, with our own needs, rights, and
idiosyncrasies. We are not going to become a number. The RADICAL model is
centered on trust, the type that comes from community and collaboration.
</p>

  <h3>The RADICAL Model</h3>
<p>
We are used to companies being governed by FIAT hierarchies, with an owner at
the top sending down commands telling people <em>what</em> to do, <em>how</em>
to do it, and <em>when</em> to do it. Here we assume a RADICAL world that is, at
the same time, alike and different from our world today.
</p>
<p>
In the RADICAL model, a <em>company</em> is a group of people coming together to
create something bigger than each of them. Other labels abound, but we chose the
word “company” because it has an interesting genesis: it comes from the Latin
<em>con-</em> and <em>pan</em>. The prefix <em>con-</em> means “together, with”
and <em>pan</em> means “bread, food.” At its root, then, <em>company</em> means
“people who break bread together.” In the RADICAL model a company is a community
of people who come together to contribute broad value to society and make an
impact on the world.
</p>
<p>
Rather than having an owner and a hierarchy of bosses, a RADICAL company has
co-owners and co-managers to govern and operate it. These people align
themselves according to the impact they want to make, why they are doing so, and
then they embark on many experiments to get there.

  <h3>Evolution, Interrupted</h3>
<p>
As I see it, the RADICAL model of co-ownership and co-management is the next
stage in collaboration. Everything humanity has accomplished has been based on
collaboration, but we have acted as if dominance by a few is the only way to
achieve it.<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The dominance model of collaboration has become an obstacle to real progress and
it is now getting in the way of the next surge of human accomplishments. Now
it’s time to move on and build on the foundation of interdependence towards a
higher level of collaboration.
</p>

<h2>A World-Wide Market</h2>
<p>
A world-wide market would bring us together rather than keeping us siloed by the
Rube Goldberg markets we have today.
</p>
<p>
We could have a single world government create and enforce a single currency.
But even if it were politically feasible, it is unnecessary and a move in the
wrong direction towards centralization. To wit, we didn’t need a single world
government for minutes, meters, or the Internet, some of the most useful
world-wide tools of all time.
</p>
<p>
A decentralized, transparent COIN is fundamental to such a unified market. These
are some of the other things we would need to nourish and support a world-wide
market,
</p>

  <h3>Decentralized Market</h3>
<p>
We need a decentralized market to nurture the next stage of innovation and
accomplishment.
</p>
<p>
National fiat coins are not very stable and bring with them a lot of cyclical
crises.<sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> They make
international markets very complex, opaque, and very expensive.
</p>
<p>
Today’s international markets have been cobbled together by agreements that are
fraught with weaknesses. National and international politics make transaction
costs very expensive. Worst of all, these international markets are unduly
influenced by transnational businesses seeking to profit no matter the harm to
society.
</p>
<p>
A decentralized market can truly be a pricing engine, free of interference and
manipulation.
</p>

  <h3>Decentralized Minting</h3>
<p>
We need decentralized minting of COINs to take national and international
politics out of it and to eliminate the influence of transnational corporations.
</p>
<p>
COINs are minted by companies, not any national government or central banks.
</p>

  <h3>Transparent COINs</h3>
<p>
National fiat coins are opaque. In theory that’s good because it reduces
transaction costs. But this “reduction of costs” also disables human choice.
</p>
<p>
In any case, the big transaction costs are those that banks, exchanges, and
political manipulation bring in. And opaqueness does not reduce any of those.
</p>
<p>
RADICAL COINs are transparent. An integral part of each COIN is the log that
comes along with them. This will restore people’s  ability to make choices based
on that information.
</p>

  <h3>Trusted Measure</h3>
<p>
A measure can be “trusted” because it means the same thing to people anywhere.
RADs, too, can be trusted if you believe that people are pretty much the same
anywhere.
</p>
<p>
In a rural setting somebody will get RADs for milking a goat, while in an urban
setting someone else will get RADs for stopping cars so children can cross the
street. The same human feeling that acted in the rural case was active in the
urban setting. The value of capturing that feeling in tangible ways is more
important than its number accuracy. RADs, and the COINs that they factor, can be
trusted because the “pricing engine,” meaning each of us, is the same.
</p>

<h2>RAD Distributions</h2>
<p>
This idea originated with entrepreneur and pioneer Philip Rosedale.<sup
id="fnref10"><a href="#fn10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> This is a practice that
he’s deployed at his various businesses,
</p>
<ul>
<li>As the company grows, every month an equal amount of cash and shares of the
company are earmarked for distribution.</li>
<li>Every member gets an equal portion of the wealth the company generated.</li>
<li>Rather than keeping them for themselves, people give this money and shares
out to <em>anybody</em> they feel has contributed during the month.</li>
<li>There is no set criteria and each person decides <em>who</em> should be
recognized, <em>what</em> should be recognized as a contribution, and <em>how
much</em> to give to others.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The RADICAL Distributions is very similar, but instead of cash or stocks, it
uses RADs, a dimensionless unit. At the end of each Distribution the total
number of RADs allocated to each person represents their dynamic percentage of ownership of the
broad value created by a company.
</p>
<p>
Because broad value accounts for things other than financial value, RADs account
for the uncountable.<sup id="fnref11"><a href="#fn11"
rel="footnote">11</a></sup> And because COINs are <em>factored through</em>
RADs, they represent broad value as well. In other words, each person's share of
COINs is a function of their contributions and reflects the full spectrum of
human values, not just financial value.
</p>

<h2>COIN</h2>
<p>
These are a few of the qualities that a COIN must have. They are in no
particular order.
</p>
<h3>Decentralized Minting</h3>
<p>
COINs are minted by companies, not a national government.
</p>

<img src="images/image2.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip">
</p>
<p>
For example, BenCO mints 30,000 COINs and promises to repay them in three years.
All this information goes on a transparent digital store (<em>e.g.</em>,
blockchain or similar secure) that would include, at a minimum,
</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of COINs (30,000),</li>
<li>The name of the company which minted them (BenCO),</li>
<li>The retiring terms (three years),</li>
<li>The repayment terms (10,000 COINs/year).</li>
</ul>
<p>
This can result in any of these scenarios,

<h4><p style="text-align: right">

   </td>
   <td>BenCO has retired only two thirds of the minted COIN by the third year.

   </td>
   <td>BenCO disbands and never creates enough value for society to pay the
30,000 COINs.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
A seller’s app can calculate a risk factor based on the BenCO COIN’s log
<em>and</em> her particular preset parameters. Each of us can let the apps do
the calculations and, based on that, decide whether or not to take the BenCO
COINs as payment.<sup id="fnref12"><a href="#fn12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>
</p>

  <h3>Stability</h3>
<p>
In today’s system of exchange, “reserve currencies” are used for international
transactions. This makes these transactions very expensive.
</p>
<p>
As of this writing, the four most widely held “reserve currencies” are the US
dollar ($), the European Euro (€), the Japanese Yen (¥), and the UK Pound
Sterling (£). These national fiat coinage are backed up by strong, stable
economies. At least, that’s how the story goes.
</p>
<p>
As guarantors of COINs, how do companies compare with national economies? For
one, national economies are not as stable as all that and financial crises
happen on a cyclical basis.<sup id="fnref13"><a href="#fn13"
rel="footnote">13</a></sup> For another, people invariably find ways to exploit
some aspect of the financial system for private gain. Politicians are very good
at this and manipulate national economies shamelessly. For example, in 1971 then
President Nixon renounced gold as a standard and blamed it mostly on De Gaulle’s
policies. In reality, he did it to maintain “global economic dominance and to
improve economic conditions at home.”<sup id="fnref14"><a href="#fn14"
rel="footnote">14</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
By comparison, companies are extremely stable because their reputation depends
solely on how effective they are at creating value for society. That’s it. The
worst that can happen is that a company mints COINs and then it is not able, or
willing, to retire the debt. The financial impact of this would be
insignificant; to wit, this is what happens today.
</p>
<h3>Fungible</h3>
<p>
In today’s financial model, to be effective as a medium of exchange, money must
be fungible—one coin is indistinguishable from all others. “Trying to use a
non-fungible good as money results in transaction costs of individually
evaluating each unit of the good before an exchange can take place.”<sup
id="fnref15"><a href="#fn15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, COINs are fungible, world-wide. Their transaction costs, nationally
and internationally, are negligible. Their only transaction cost is that of
“evaluating” each payment and whether or not to accept the risk associated with
it. But this is automated and insignificant. The other cost is deciding whether
to accept a given mix of COINs as payment, and that carries no financial cost
since most transactions would be driven by the app’s results and the few
exceptions to it would be driven by people to people relationships. This takes
those transactions out of the financial realm and into a people-to-people
one.<sup id="fnref16"><a href="#fn16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup>
</p>

  <h3>Broad Value</h3>
<p>
To be robust, a COIN needs to be tied to value creation, and COINs are. In fact
they represent more than financial value. Their value also represents wellbeing,
acts of kindness, and whatever else people consider important. And since COINs
are factored through RADs they represent broad value contributions as well.
</p>
<p>
For example, if the RADs that have been allocated to me amount to 10% of the
total and yours to 20%, this means that our fellow co-owners decided that you
contributed twice as much as I did. As a result you get twice as many COINs as I
do.
</p>

  <h3>Transparent</h3>
<p>
National fiat coins are opaque. We make do with things like GDP, but GDP and
others like it don’t measure anything besides financial value. They are
canonical examples of the Broken Window Fallacy and don’t take into account
society-wide costs. What’s more, these indices can be very misleading, and “GDP
can increase after a car accident or a major flood. GDP can grow rapidly during
a war or after a terrorist attack.”<sup id="fnref17"><a href="#fn17"
rel="footnote">17</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
COINs are transparent and we need them to be. Each COIN carries with it a log of
all the information necessary to calculate the potential risks and benefits
associated with it. Given that information, each of us can then decide whether
or not to accept a particular COIN as payment.
</p>

  <h3>COIN Value</h3>
<p>
The face value of national fiat coins is fixed forever. At least, that is true
for reserve currencies. Other national fiat coins are not so lucky: their face
value stays put, but their purchasing power fluctuates, sometimes wildly.
</p>
<p>
COINs have a face value of one. It is backed by people who come together as
RADICAL COMPANIES to create broad value for society. It is free from national
and international politics and manipulation.
</p>
<p>
The face value of COINs never changes but the information in its log may. Based
on all of that, each of us gets to decide whether or not to accept the COINs
given the risks and benefits indicated in its log..
</p>

  <h3>Company Value</h3>
<p>
As it is today, different companies will end up with different values and their
co-owners will have more or less purchasing power. For example,
</p>
<ul>
<li>Company BenCO earns 100 COINs.</li>
<li>Company JerryCo earns 1,000 COINs.</li>
<li>JerryCo’s <em>value</em> is higher than BenCO.</li>
<li>JerryCO <em>people earn more COINs</em> than those at BenCO.</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Guarantors</h3>
<p>
COINs are backed up by the RADICAL COMPANIES, not national governments. This
means that the COIN’s “value” is determined by what each company brings to
society and by its co-owners’ sensitivities.
</p>
<p>
This last bit is really important.
</p>
<p>
In today’s businesses, the owners can do whatever they want. Although the same
is technically true for a RADICAL COMPANY it will be a lot more unlikely that
all co-owners would agree to do something that goes against their own values and
communities.
</p>
<p>
For example, if a community feels harmed by the actions of CarelessCO they can
make their case to a few of its co-owners to at least get a conversation going.
If the harm affects many such communities and all its co-owners refuse to
engage, they can simply record the failed discussion to CarelessCO’s COINs. Some
people may interpret this as a high risk (to society) while others may see it
differently. We all get to decide.
</p>

<h2>Risks and Benefits</h2>
<p>
There is plenty of evidence that shows that a currency, one that actually
actually flows, can benefit a society,<sup id="fnref18"><a href="#fn18"
rel="footnote">18</a></sup> while money stuffed under a mattress only benefits
the hoarder.
</p>
<p>
One way to keep money flowing is by having it lose its value over time
(<em>i.e.</em>, there is no point in hoarding it because it will “rot”). This
can be done by inflation or demurrage. Inflation, the decline of purchasing
power, has been the preferred method of national governments for controlling the
value and availability of its coinage. Governments can do this by tweaking
interest rates, which impacts the supply of national fiat coins. For most of us,
this all happens very mysteriously. We all know that “inflation is bad,” but we
cannot do anything about it.
</p>
<p>
The other approach is by demurrage where coins <em>lose</em> their value over
time. There’s been a number of local deployments of demurrage coins and they are
generally beneficial to the local economy. However, as far as I know, demurrage
has never been used at a national level. The poster child of demurrage is the
"Miracle of Wörgl."<sup id="fnref19"><a href="#fn19" rel="footnote">19</a></sup>
During the Great Depression, the town of Wörgl, Austria, was quickly running out
of money, like most of the world. The mayor issued Wörgls to pay people for
doing local jobs and the local shops agreed to accept them. The bills had to be
stamped every week in order to keep them valid, and every stamp reduced the
value of these coins. This kept the notes in circulation. So much so, that
people even paid taxes earlier rather than let their currency “rot.”

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

<p>
One problem with demurrage is that its rate of decay is not tied to value
creation or anything like it. For example, kept its face value for a week Wörgl
and went down in value every week thereafter. The Wära, another demurrage coin,
lost 1% of its value every month.<sup id="fnref21"><a href="#fn21"
rel="footnote">21</a></sup> These rates of decay are, for all intents and
purposes, picked out of thin air.
</p>
<p>
COINs, on the other hand, are always the same value. What changes is the
potential risks and benefits associated with the company that engendered it.
Every COIN carries a log of all the information people need to decide whether or
not to accept it.

  <h3>Calculating Risk</h3>
<p>
A COIN‘s log may include, for example, the number of co-owners that agree to its
mint, the company’s revenue history, how many COINs the company has minted, and
the company’s debt performance. Given the COIN’s log, we can calculate the risk
associated with every COIN and decide whether or not to accept a particular COIN
as payment.
</p>
<p>
One side-effect of this, is that people will try to dilute what risk they hold
by paying with a combination of low and high risk COINs, enough of each to make
the risk acceptable to the seller.<sup id="fnref22"><a href="#fn22"
rel="footnote">22</a></sup>
</p>

  <h3>Calculating Benefits</h3>
<p>
Over time, companies will go up in value because they get very efficient,
benefit from high demand, or both. People will likely hold on to their COINs. It
may be that they are more comfortable with risk and may not mind taking higher
risk COINs from fledgling companies. It may also be that even the more
conservative folks may be tempted to take high risk COINs from high potential
companies.

  <h3>Other Value Factors</h3>
<p>
Other things that may affect company value,
</p>
<ul>
<li>As a company creates more value, it gets more revenue, and it generates more
COINs. The revenue COINs are allocated according to each person’s broad
contributions. Co-owners decide what is a broad contribution according to the
value they perceive.</li>
<li>If a company walks away from debt,<sup id="fnref23"><a href="#fn23"
rel="footnote">23</a></sup> it’s reputation goes down, and its COINs go down in
value.</li>
<li>As a company retires debt, its reputation goes up, and its COINs go up in
value.</li>
<li>If the reputation and value of a company goes up, its COINs go down in risk.
Those who took its COINs when they were high risk now have more desirable COINs.
The upside spreads throughout society.</li>
<li>Companies that are constantly creating debt and not retiring it, will find
themselves isolated. Their COINs will get riskier and riskier and they will be
acceptable to fewer and fewer people. Hopefully, they will see guidance and help
from others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>TADDA!</h2>
<p>
RADs account for what so far has been unaccountable. People get to decide what a
contribution is and by doing so they “measure” what has been unmeasurable: an
act of kindness, spontaneous help. Co-owners get COINs according to the
percentage of RADs they have and that makes COINs a much broader measure than
just financial value.
</p>
<p>
Companies mint COINs. This means that COINs are decentralized and free of
interference by national and international politics, financial institutions, and
too-big-to-fail transnationals. COINs will make it possible to create a
world-wide market that Adam Smith would be happy with.<sup id="fnref24"><a
href="#fn24" rel="footnote">24</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The whole system is transparent and each of us can decide to accept a payment or
not. It is not mysterious or left to robed experts to figure things out. Each of
us can do it because each of us is an expert on our own sensitivities and how we
interpret the world.

<h2>Bad Actors</h2>
<p>
There may not be as many bad actors as we think. We probably have a
preponderance of them today because 1) they make the news, and 2) we live in a
system that is meant to reward bad behavior: gaming is part and parcel of the
system. As we find out, we patch it to prevent other bad actors from exploiting
the same weakness. But then the next batch of bad actors become wealthy by
discovering and exploiting new weaknesses.
</p>
<p>
We don’t normally think of these, below, as bad actors. But they are. They fall
back on their FIAT world habits and are a drag on moving forward to a RADICAL
world.

   </td>
   <td>One type of “bad actor” is people who “go along.” We normally don’t think
of them as bad actors, “they’re just nice people.” In any case, Shui is one of
them. He notices that Namir is taking more than he contributed, but he doesn’t
say anything and talks to Namir. Shui turns a blind eye towards Namir's bad
behavior and goes by untested assumptions. “Namir is a nice guy and maybe he
needs a little bit more than me.”</td>

<h4><p style="text-align: right">
Battling Ghosts</p>
</h4>
   </td>
   <td>The other type of bad actor is the one who gets pulled into behavior that
he normally would not condone.
<p>
For example, Anita, a BenCO co-owner, wants to buy potatoes. The potato seller,
Shui, looks at the COINs coming from her, but refuses to accept them. It turns
out that all of Anita’s COINs come from BenCO and the company has not lived up
to its promises. Shui is a very conservative type and he refuses to exchange her
COINs for his potatoes. She explains the reasons why they had not made the first
year payment on time, “and we will by the end of this week.” Nevertheless, Shui
is unmoved and puts the potatoes back in their bin.
<p>
Further down the road, Namir sees the same log that Shui got, but he,
nevertheless, accepts Anita’s COINs in exchange for his potatoes. It turns out
that Namir knows Anita and what they are doing at BenCO and he trusts that they
will retire their debts.
<p>
Shui sees the exchange, misinterprets it, and instead of talking with Namir he
goes on to accept higher risk COINs that he is comfortable with. Instead of
talking to Namir and figuring out what’s going on, he falls into his own trap of
assuming Namir is out to take business away from him.

<h2>Varying Buying Power</h2>
<p>
I am selling potatoes at 40 COINs per dozen. After the first month
<strong>Ⓐ</strong>, below, and his co-owners don’t have enough COINs to buy my
potatoes, but <strong>Ⓔ</strong> and his co-owners do. It may be that JerryCO is
more efficient or maybe its products or services are more valuable. Either way,
BenCO’s co-owners end up with less buying power than JerryCO’s co-owners.

<p>
Within each company, the buying power of an individual co-owner, too, can change
every cycle. For example, in the illustration above, by the third cycle
<strong>Ⓔ</strong>, a JerryCO co-owner who started with 100 COINs, now has 1,200
which are enough to buy 30 dozen of my potatoes. Other other hand, JerryCO
co-owner <strong>Ⓗ</strong> didn't get any COINs this cycle and he only has 600
COINs and has to settle for 15 dozen of my potatoes.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Companies minting COINs without any rules sounds really, really!</h3>
<p>
If that sounds “crazy,” then the financial system we have today is crazier and
business hostile.
</p>
<p>
COINs minted by BenCO carry a log which includes all the information related to
their creation. The co-owners are motivated to retire the COINs they minted in
the time promised. If they don’t do that, fewer and fewer sellers will accept
their COINs. Their buying power will go down the drain in a hurry.
</p>
<h3>Why not make co-owners responsible for personally retiring the debt?</h3>
<h3>What prevents a company from continuously taking on new debt to retire old
debt?</h3>
<p>
Co-owners could decide to do this, but it goes on the record, so to speak, for
everyone to see. As sellers detect that pattern, they would shy away from the
company’s COINs.
</p>
<h3>What if co-owners pay themselves a huge amount of COINs and keep taking new
debt to paper over it? Wouldn’t this create massive inflation?</h3>
<p>
Co-owners could decide to do this, but it goes on the record, so to speak, for
everyone to see. As sellers detect that pattern, they would shy away from the
company’s COINs. They may have lots and lots of COINs, but they would not be
welcome by most people.
</p>
<h3>Let’s say that the potato grower uses the COINs he got from selling her
potatoes to buy a shovel. But then the town’s shovel-maker raised his prices so
that he can buy metal and wood dowels to make more shovels.</h3>
<p>
Yes, that could happen, as it does today.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, another shovel-maker would appear and make shovels that people can
afford. The greedy shovel maker would go out of business.
</p>
<h3>PotatoCO mints COINs to pay for the now higher priced shovel.</h3>
<p>
If PotatoCO’s co-owners figure that the new price is a fair price and there’s no
other supplier around, it would have to do that. They would have to make sure
that they can get enough COINs from future potatoes to retire the debt as
promised. Otherwise, they are going to pay with a lower reputation and value and
less buying power for the co-owners.
</p>
<p>
People will continue to make mistakes and miss estimates. COINs won’t change
human nature. But co-owners can mint the COINs they need to run their companies
without worrying about the color of their skin, or their gender, or church
affiliation.
</p>
<h3>But this means that another potato grower buys a tractor and grows even more
potatoes!</h3>
<p>
Yes. This means that people can experiment more.
</p>
<p>
Maybe the tractor turns out to be a lemon and doesn’t help him produce more or
better potatoes. He probably won’t be able to retire the debt he took on to buy
it.
</p>
<h3>What if JerryCO, a brand new startup with no revenue, needs COINs to get
started, can it just mint them?</h3>
<p>
In this case, most vendors would likely not accept JerryCO’s COINs as payments
because its COINs would have very high risk.
</p>
<p>
In this case, other companies may want to help out JerryCO by giving them COINs.
One or more companies could mint enough COINs for JerryCO  to get to revenue or
to build its minimum viable product. This could include vendors of equipment
that JerryCO needs to succeed and the quid pro quo is that they will become
JerryCO’s preferred vendors.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, the investment may come from a group of adjacent companies. They
believe that JerryCO’s product is complementary to theirs and will help the
market grow. Or JerryCO promises to “repay” twice the original amount of this
investment.
</p>
<p>
In any case, as JerryCO starts to show results and a pattern of doing as
promised, the risk of its own COINs will go down and will be able to pay with a
mix of its own COINs and co-investment COINs.
</p>
<h3>What if a BenCO co-owner wants to buy the latest electric, self-driving car,
but she doesn’t get enough COINs? Can’t she convince the other co-owners to pay
themselves more COINs?</h3>
<p>
For BenCO co-owners to pay themselves a lot more COINs than they actually
receive in revenue, they would have to mint the extra COINs. These newly minted
COINs would show a lot of risks and sellers would likely not accept them as
payment, particularly for luxury items.
</p>

<h3>Do you mean that there is no possible way to defraud the system?</h3>
<p>
It simply means that I can’t think of a way of doing that.
</p>
<p>
Every time I think of something, the system manages to protect itself. And it is
all because of the transparency built into it.
</p>
<p>
I can imagine that there could be a way to falsify a COIN’s log, but I’ll leave
that to smarter people.
</p>

<h2>Why can’t people mint COINs? Why is it limited to companies?</h2>
<p>
Community!
</p>
<p>
In the RADICAL model, a company is a community of people who come together to
contribute broad value to society and make an impact in the world. This means
that co-owners may be motivated to mind COINs, but the risks of doing so may
hold them back. Do we believe that we can retire the debt? Can we do as we are
promising?
</p>
<p>
Maybe individuals can weigh all those considerations by themselves, but I know I
couldn’t, at least not in a balanced way. When the pros and cons are weighed by
the broader consideration of a community, the final decision is more balanced.
</p>

  <h3>What if a company mints COINs and then is not able to retire the debt?</h3>
<p>
Yes, this kind of thing will happen. And, in case you’re asking, there is no
punishment for the people involved in this.
</p>
<p>
The overall costs will be negligible. It happens all the time today and nobody
notices. Yes, the people involved in a bankruptcy get punished, ruthlessly so.
But the system absorbs the losses, magically.
</p>

  <h3>What about people who retired on their CarelessCO’s COINs?</h3>
<p>
I think that in a RADICAL world, “retiring” will be a thing of the past
(<em>i.e.</em>, our present). People “retire” today because they’ve been putting
up with their job for many years and they are burned out in more ways than one.
</p>
<p>
In a RADICAL world, the more likely scenario is that people may decide to not
join another company for a while and live instead off their portfolio of RADs
from their past companies. This type of “retiring” will not be a function of age
or tiresomeness, it will be of choice.
</p>
<p>
So, let’s say that I decide to travel the world on a sailboat, paying for it
with CarelessCO’s COINs and CarelessCO disbands. There could be three cases,
</p>
<ol>
<li>The COINs I have are pre-disband and their log attests to it. I feel bad
because they had a lot of potential, but they got careless and cocky,
over-promised, and could not meet their commitments.
<li>The COINs I have are mostly pre-disband, but I do have some that the company
minted. The amount is very minor, I’ll have to switch to a smaller boat.
Besides, I am earning COINs while on the boat by writing about my journey.
<li>All the COINs I have are the ones discredited. In fact, I was one of the
co-owners who supported the minting (we were sure we could do it). In this case,
I screwed myself financially, but I learned something in the process. I have to
return the boat and join WiserCO.</li>
</ol>

  <h3>What if lots of companies disband at the same time?</h3>
<p>
Then you adjust your app to raise the risk of similar companies.
</p>

  <h3>What about people who cannot work?</h3>
<p>
Some people will be unable to contribute to a company, for whatever reason. But
to their family
</p>
<h3>Is risk associated with companies or with COINs?</h3>
<p>
A COINs log includes all the information needed to calculate the COIN’s
potential risk and benefits. But, this date comes from the company behind the
minted COINs. In all likelihood, it would include the number of co-owners who
agreed to the mint and its how well they’ve kept to their promises. It would
also include that a case has been made by several communities that the company
is harming them and whether or not the situation has been resolved to the
communities’ satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
For each COINs, the log holds facts, not judgements and each of us gets to
decide what to do with them.
