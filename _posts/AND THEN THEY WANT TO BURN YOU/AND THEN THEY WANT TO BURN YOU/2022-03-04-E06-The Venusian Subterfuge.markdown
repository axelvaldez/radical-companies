<h1 style="text-align: center;">THE VENUSIAN SUBTERFUGE</h1>

<p>
Brent looked out over the endless sea of clouds blanketing Venus. Every human
space station, since Mir, has had a viewport to look out onto the cosmos. On the
International Space Station it was the Cupola, a multifaceted observation area
where you could look at the Earth for hours while you float in microgravity. In
the Bigelow habitat, it’s the Bubble, a three-sixty, inflatable sphere that lets
you look at Jupiter in all of its intensity. And here, in the Glass Boat, while
reclining on a comfortable couch staring through the floor at the clouds below,
Brent made his plans to trick the Earth Authority delegation into believing that
everything was in order.
</p>
<p>
The Earth Authority had a few principles on which its authoritarian rule was
founded: maintain the peace throughout the Solar system by keeping a strict
hierarchy in every organization on Earth. This meant every organization had a
CEO, a COO, and a CFO. There was even some wiggle room, for example, you could
have a CXO for user experience. Or maybe you wanted to integrate well with
non-profits and needed a CNGO, to interact with the Non-Governmental
Organizations of the world. Below all of these were managers, and below them
were lesser managers, and finally, hopefully, perhaps, people who actually did
something.
</p>
<p>
IT. WAS. THE. LAW.
</p>
<p>
To enforce the law, the Earth Authority had Mirror organizations that watched
over their siblings. The Venusian Mirror organization was finally on its way,
and Brent was desperately trying to organize a defense for the Venusian research
colony, which had spent the last twenty years drifting into what it’s called a
RADICAL co-organizing. The colony had gotten along this way because resources
were tight and a Mirror Authority would have been too expensive.
</p>
<p>
The crew delayed the Mirror Authority from occupying the station as long as
possible by concocting all sorts of accidents. An oxygen leak. Circuit damage
from solar flares. Hull ablation from an acid in the atmosphere. In the end,
Earth must have been suspicious because they had only been able to delay the
mission by two years. And now, the Mirror Authority will be here in two weeks.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the station existed without managers. People self-organized into
groups and after conversations and on-going planning they would set up bubbles
for scientific instruments and attend to the constant needs of an entirely
artificial living space. Everyone, in the eyes of the colony, owned the station
as a collective. The ownership was equitable, not equal, thanks to a system they
called RADs to assign ownership.
</p>
<p>
For example, right after they had lied to the Mirror about a solar flare, there
really was a solar flare, and they had to repair a bunch of electronic damage to
electronics on the station that had been unshielded. Allen, a former manager,
discovered a technique similar to degaussing and repaired a bunch of electronics
that everyone thought they would have to reprint. Every week, the crew would get
an equal share of RADs, and then assign those RADs to other people. You could
not assign RADs to yourself. That week, Allen really cleaned up and many of the
crew gave him their entire share of RADs.
</p>
<p>
 Brent remembered the last discussion they had, all one hundred and forty two
people, tightly packed into the main bubble. People would go to the center of
the circle and discuss their ideas about what to do about the Mirror Authority.
There was total unanimity in everyone not wanting to go back to the old way of
having a static hierarchy. They still had temporary hierarchies for dangerous
things like excursions on the hull of the station. There, it made sense to have
someone with their hand over life and death. But every day was not a life and
death emergency, and for everything else hierarchies would come and go as
needed.
</p>
<p>
One idea was to kill everyone on the Mirror spaceship and revolt. Announce their
independence and go to war with Earth. To Brent’s relief, this idea did not have
a lot of traction. Not many were willing to be murderers.
</p>
<p>
Another was to find some way to hack into the approaching ship’s computer and
send them off course. While that idea was being thrown around, someone did
calculations while sitting at the periphery of the bubble and yelled out that it
would be murdering them as well. They didn’t have enough food on board. Someone
pointed out that some of them would survive from cannibalism. The murder faction
tried to sway people with this option, since it seemed less direct than doing it
in person.
</p>
<p>
Other people just wanted to come clean, tell the Authoritarians about everything
that had happened on the space station. They could tell the Mirror how they
learned to organize themselves with leadership teams, rough consensus, and RADs.
Everything was transparent and decentralized. No one loomed over your shoulder,
or withheld resources or information to hold power over you. It was a paradise
in comparison to life on Earth. The society in action should be persuasive
enough by itself, so some claimed. These were mostly people who rarely worked
with Mirror counterparts. Twenty years of doing things Radically made it hard to
remember the static and brittle hierarchies.
</p>
<p>
The option they finally agreed on was to co-opt them and slowly turn them to
their Radical ways. Create a fake fiat hierarchy, with bosses and what not, but
continue to use their practices with the <em>blessing</em> of the bosses.
</p>
<p>
A massive subterfuge of fake emails and video communications would be needed, in
case they had to communicate about their co-managing and co-owning intentions.
This would be relatively easy because hierarchies on Earth typically produced
copious amounts of useless paperwork. And most of it was just stupid ritual.
</p>
<p>
Conversations by managers would also be easy to simulate, given enough video
recording, they would be able to simulate people’s faces. And given enough
reliance on buzzwords, best practices, and reams of technological jargon the
mirror would be unable to understand, they could create whole conversations with
total believability. The problem was the station occupants were all much more
cheery and alive now, and none of them had video of them looking dull, tense,
and nervous like they used to in their old meetings. They would have to do some
aging of their faces to make the archives of their younger selves more
believable.
</p>
<p>
The hardest part would really be pretending. Trying to be someone you are not as
long as it might take to slowly co-opt the Mirror to their way of doing things.
They would need endless practice sessions. And one couldn’t laugh at the whole
farce of it all.
</p>
<p>
Brent set to work on building a system of systematic lies.
</p>
<p>
Two weeks later, the Mirror Authority arrived at the Venusian Airship Colony.
</p>
<p>
The Mirror CEO greeted the executive staff curtly. Handshakes were given. Dinner
was had. Underlings had their own separate working dinner, where they exchanged
all of the latest reports on paper. It was a ritual from olden days when paper
was used for such things. Documents were signed by hand instead of with your
cryptographic key.
</p>
<p>
Later, the Mirror staff were escorted to their Silo. The Mirror lived separately
from the organization that they monitored. It would not do to have them
fraternize with those they were expected to reprimand and punish for deviating
from The Way Things Are Done. Fortunately, this made the subterfuge even easier
for the Radicals.
</p>
<p>
After dropping the Mirror off at its Silo, the Radicals had a huge party
celebrating the success of the deception. None of the Mirror had seemed the
least bit suspicious.
</p>
<p>
For a few months the subterfuge went on without a hitch. People did whatever
they wanted, working however they liked without shame for doing so. And whenever
the Mirror walked through for an all-hands or stand-up meeting, everyone’s
digital assistant would inform them of the impending invasion.
</p>
<p>
It would have all gone well, if Alex had not cracked. Brent was standing at a
phoney meeting, and Alex was giving a presentation on the efficiency of the
power reactor, when he looked directly at the Mirror representative reclining at
the head of the table and spilled everything, and said he couldn’t take it
anymore. Alex just wanted to be told what to do. It’s all a sham. For a brief
moment, the Mirror Agent didn’t react at all. In hierarchies people regularly
break down all the time. It’s part and parcel to the self-amputation one must do
to fit in. The Mirror Agent thought that’s what’s going on, and they almost got
Alex out of the room, but he pleaded with the agent to check the regularity of
the logs before they could shove him out the door.
</p>
<p>
They thought they had fixed things and smoothed things over with the agent,
telling him Alex was one of their hardest workers, and he had probably just been
in crunch time just a little too often this month. They even assigned a few
people to manually watch the comms back to Earth to make sure the Mirror didn’t
send anything out of the ordinary. The mirror did send a worrisome request for
further analysis of ‘Compliance with Best Practices,’ a euphemism for
insurrection. Brent and the others faked a signal from Earth commanding the
Mirror here to desist prosecuting insurrection and it worked. The Mirror
received the command and stopped investigating. It was not for them to ask why.
In hierarchies, power flowed only one way.
</p>
<p>
They had used the hierarchy to preserve their freedom.
</p>
<p>
Or so they thought. One day Wilhelmina, the woman in charge of station threat
tracking, who would laser the occasional micro meteorite that could potentially
damage the airship, called an authentic all-hands. She told them there was a
troop ship on its way from Earth. Gasps of disbelief were soon replaced with
panicked voices. It was one thing to be caught by a Mirror Agent. You would just
be demoted or transferred. Or perhaps wages would be docked or access to
resources. A visit by the Mirror Marines meant firings. And not the old type of
firings. To be fired meant no one would hire or fund you. Your saved up income
would eventually run out and you would eventually die of starvation or exposure.
</p>
<p>
People started to immediately look suspiciously at Alex, who had come back
around to their Radical position and had apologized for almost giving up the
game. He begged them to believe he had not betrayed them. But if it was not him,
who had?
</p>
<p>
An engineer typed furiously into a personal counsel at the back of the room. The
room was so loud he hit the emergency horn once to shut everyone up. He
explained that as much as he would like to throw Alex out of an airlock for
almost getting their little utopia cancelled it was not him. He had just
navigated probes all around the station and discovered there was a second comms
antenna that only the Mirror knew about. They had been sending out a
simultaneous radio signal alongside the ones they were sending from the
legitimate comms they all had access to.
</p>
<p>
The Mirror had been running its own subterfuge by pretending to be duped.
</p>
<p>
The Marine ship used a special drive to get to emergency Compliance situations.
There would be no time to prepare. They would be there in days. Wilhelmina, the
most willing to commit violence offered to use the anti-meteorite system to
destroy the oncoming ship. Cooler heads determined the Marine ship would be
guarded against such things. The jig was up.
</p>
<p>
Four and half days later Marines descended on the floating city. Even though
inhabitants had signaled their surrender, the Marines blew the airlock open. A
giant of a man stepped through doorway handcuffs in his hands. The station's
Mirror CEO rushed up to meet him. He pointed an accusatory finger at the
station’s bygone CEO who had ironically been the one to instigate the beginnings
of Radical co-management on the station. Brent looked down saddened that their
way of life was over.
</p>
<p>
As Brent looked back up after hearing a cry of shock, the Marine was pushing a
handcuffed Mirror CEO through the airlock and into the Marine ship. The Marines
were bursting out in laughter at the surprised station crew. The Marines had
already gone native only a few months prior to receiving the message to come and
fire the rebellion. They had just started to self-organize and convert their
Mirror Agents to a more free way of organizing, but like the crew of the
Venusian Colony at the beginning of their transition they were similarly
struggling around on how to do so. They were struggling with how to throw off
their mental shackles. The Venusian Mirror had sent the Marines everything they
had collected on how the Venusians were co-organizing and the Marines had
quickly used this as a blueprint to self organize and maintain a virtual parody
of themselves they could continue to fool the rest of the world with.
</p>
<p>
The Marines rounded up the Mirror Agents. Once they were all in the brig, the
whole station partied like the universe was about to end. Eventually, the Mirror
Agents asked to stay as part of the habitat crew.
</p>
<p>
Everyone asked what was happening on Jupiter and how big was the revolt there.
Marine General Pura Cintron, who refused to be called “General,” smiled as she
climbed back into her ship. There was no revolt. They had faked one. They had
always just wanted to go to Jupiter, and they were done being told what to do.
</p>
