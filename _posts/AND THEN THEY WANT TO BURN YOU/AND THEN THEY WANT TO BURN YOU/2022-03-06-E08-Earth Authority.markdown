<h1 style="text-align: center;">EARTH AUTHORITY</h1>

<h2>Safety Is Paramount</h2>
<p>
Meanwhile, back on Earth, the Authority remained a force for good. For about ten
years people learned to co-organize and relatively quickly the movement spread
to the point that country-level governance became obsolete. At the opposite end
of the spectrum, a violent minority held on to violence and brutality and
terrorized others. That’s when the Authority came to the rescue and brought
safety back to humanity.
</p>
<p>
It took a few years, as the RADICAL movement spread and companies became
healthier and even more financially successful. Innovation was flourishing. In
what felt as the blink of an eye, they became the new norm for businesses. This
new-found capacity to co-organize and c0-create changed people in fundamental
ways it changed the world around them. At that point, traditional static
countries with strictly defined borders gave way to co-organized, dynamic Pods
with fluid boundaries.
</p>
<p>
But it wasn’t all roses. As in everything to do with people, it was a spectrum:
from the most decentralized Pods to the smaller but violent Pods dominated by
coercion and fear.
</p>
<p>
The more centralized a Pod, the worst and more brutal life became for the people
trapped in it. As resources became more scarce, these Pods became very
aggressive towards Pods where abundance was common. However, the progressive
Pods quickly figured out how to minimize this threat by investing time and
resources to propagate experimentation and wealth creation among the would-be
attackers. It all pointed to a sustainable future for humanity, and that’s when
the Authority took shape.
</p>
<p>
The Earth Authority Pod had come together in what was formerly the southern area
of the United States. Most of the central and southern US had never quite shaken
off their authoritarian ways. Pods from this area maintained a few entitled
roles, including a Presidency. These were mostly symbolic, until Jane Ping
turned her presidency into a position of power. She renamed her Pod the Earth
Authority and created a movement to bring together the poorest, most violent
Pods into a ruthless military force.
</p>
<p>
Chairwoman Ping's Authority Pod got very efficient at slashing and burning its
way to power. Like Alexander the Great, as Ping’s Authority took over, it would
maintain a lot of the practices of the wealthier Pods–so long as it didn't
threaten her control she kept through her gigantic bureaucracy. And what kept
the bureaucracy in line was what became known as the Mirror Security Service, a
not-so-secret police which reported directly to Ping.
</p>
<p>
Outright violent resistance had not been an option for healthy Pods. A few had
opted to counter-force to keep Pin's Authority at bay, but that choice changed
them. They became more authoritarian. People who did not support the violence
had to be coerced into giving up their voice and their wealth; there was even
conscription involved in a few cases. Once a Pod  chose the path of violence,
principles got corrupted, commitments became meaningless words, and these Pods
became ripe for the Authority’s takeover.
</p>
<p>
After a relatively short but intense struggle, the Authority won. It took over
and imposed its ways on all of humanity. Chairwoman Ping’s “safety is paramount”
became the unifying cry. She got to define what “safe” meant and anything that
threatened her absolute power wasn’t and was eliminated one way or another.
</p>

<h2>Divine Power</h2>
<p>
The Authority’s law and order meant safety and it meant the absence of war. The
Authority ruled over all political and military power and did away with
hostilities among people. Safety was paramount.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the Authority had to deploy force whenever a threat arose. For the
safety of the people, of course. For example, the religion Ministers protected
the Authority from extremists and their made up deities and they deployed force
as often as needed. For the safety of the people.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, the religion Ministers were not part of Ping’s original scheme.
Much like it happened at the collapse of the Mughal era and the rise of the
British colonial government in India, the rise of the Authority created a rigid,
hierarchical system that reshaped social groups into divided communities that
could be more easily controlled. The people who ended up as Religious Ministers
convinced their significant following that the Authority’s power had to be,
indeed, divine. Chairwoman Ping brought them into her ruling hierarchy and it
made the Authority the <em>de facto</em> catholic religion.
</p>
<h2>Solar Authority</h2>
<p>
Ironically, in spite of its official name, the Authority extended its power
beyond planet Earth and its power reached out  to the Solar habitats that had
been deployed by the prosperous Pods. From  the tiny Venus to the extensive
Jovian habitat, all were forced to organize along the Authority’s strict
hierarchy and to report according to their bureaucratic procedures. The Mirror
agents made sure of it and that peace and order prevailed.
</p>
<p>
Establishing control of the Solar habitats was relatively cheap because it was
easy enough to tap all the communications channels and even cheaper to deep-spy
on everything that went in and out of the habitats. A couple of roaming ships
full of loyal, well-trained Mirror agents, popularly known as the Marines, was
enough to put down any signs of resistance.
</p>
<p>
The use of Worms to carry data and messages was a bit more problematic at first
because if they got through, they could dump their hidden payloads on Solarnet
in the blink of an eye. That happened a couple of times, but the Authority was
able to sweep it under the rug pretty effectively. Not to worry, the Mirror
software has gotten better over time and these days it can tease out any Worm
payload that is potentially threatening to safety or to Ping’s power. When it
happened, the people involved in the treasonous act were taken care of without
much of a fuss: first the people on Earth would be taken care of and then the
spacers involved, often during a rotation, would simply disappear. Out of sight,
out of mind.
</p>
<p>
Chairwoman Ping had the whole world—and everybody else in the Solar system—in
her hands.
</p>

<h2>RADICALS</h2>
<p>
The thing about people who have experienced their whole selves is that they are
changed by it. When, on top of that, these people have become good and adept at
experimenting, they approached life, all of it, as a grand playground. And when
need be, they knew how to use their curiosity and playfulness to defend
themselves very effectively.
</p>
<p>
Trying to step out of the iron cage imposed by the bureaucracy, could be
painful, even letal when the Mirror agents got involved. But having seen a path
to a more humane future and then being cut from it was all the motivation they
needed to do something about it.
</p>
<p>
The first few attempts to bypass the deep-spying software did not end well.
People would disappear quietly and all traces of their work would disappear with
them. So they learned to get around the deep-spying software without detection.
It was a contant race, but the RADICAL folks could move very quickly and stay
way ahead of the people spying on them who were slowed down by the weight of the
hierarchy above them.
</p>
<p>
Imposed hierarchies had a price and the RADICALS took advantage of it. With a
little help from their Worms, they learned to create acceptable reports
including mistakes and the respective punishment metered out. According to the
reports, re-orgs happened often enough and people were shuffled around from one
role to another. Everybody kept competing with everybody else and some were
promoted while others got demoted. The Worms learned to make it all sound
acceptable enough.
</p>
<p>
Accidentally, they found out that many of the old Pods had a similar deep-fake
operation going on.
</p>

<h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>
Maryfer, from the old Mayabeque Pod, noticed something awkward in the reports
coming from the old Shanghai Pod. Well, she didn’t notice, but her Worms did and
they reported the anomaly to her. She didn’t think much of it, but she verified
that there was more than an even chance that these reports were not quite right.
So she consulted with Tony.
</p>
<p>
“Wait, you are getting Shanghai Pod reports, how’s that? How did you break
through all the ‘need to know’ blocks?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, no, I didn’t break through anything. My Worms pointed the reports to me,
I verified the anomaly, and here I am, talking with you. But, now that you
menti, you’re right, how did my Worms get them? And why?”
</p>
<p>
They stared at each other in silence, but you could almost hear the gears going
on in their heads. Without warning, Maryfer jumped into her Anchortron. It
sounded like she was having a nice conversation with her sister, but Tony knew
better. They did a few minutes of a performance for the Mirror’s tap and then
they walked away to speak in privacy.
</p>
<p>
“What’d you find out?”
</p>
<p>
“It seems that our Wormhole Engines have been finding others with similar enough
affinity profiles. The Shanghai report came through as one of the ‘breadcrumbs’
they were using to calculate affinity. I am guessing that  and building their
affinity profile from very similar breadcrumbs and that’s how they found each
other.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean ‘breadcrumbs?’”
</p>
<p>
“Our work leaves lots and lots of breadcrumbs behind. That's how the Mirror
discovered the first few people who tried anything like this, the ones that got
‘disappeared.’ We trained our Worms to sanitize them as soon as they were
created. Sometimes they could erase them completely, other times they could blur
them, and in a few cases they have to create a whole lot of other breadcrumbs to
obscure their provenance and render them insignificant. In any case, the Worms
learn from them, though, and incorporate them into their affinity calculations.”
</p>
<p>
“But… the Mirror’s Worms…?”
</p>
<p>
“To avoid the Mirror, our Worms have also been trained to not share that part of
their oncology to other Worms. But there is an exception for others with very
high levels of affinity, which we assumed would only be our own Worms. If, and
that’s the only thing that makes sense to me, these other Worms are learning and
building their affinity profile from very similar breadcrumbs then they would be
open to each other and try to figure out how well their profiles fit.”
</p>
<p>
“Are there others, or just Shanghai?”
</p>
<p>
“I plan to figure it out, but from what I was able to figure out without raising
suspicions, there are others and it may include Callisto and Ganymede. If that’s
true, it means…”
</p>
<p>
“No shit. This is big!”
</p>

<h2>Corruption</h2>
<p>
The Authority’s hierarchy needed corruption. In fact, all FIAT hierarchies do,
from the smallest org to dictatorships, they need corruption and couldn’t
function without it. Corruption keeps the people at the bottom busy—think of it
as a form of entertainment. And, it gives the more ambitious people a path to
power, a career path that doesn’t threaten the hierarchy itself, but protects
it.  Of course, the Mirror agents knew where to look and would make the call
when to intervene, which wasn’t often. And that’s why the Authority’s
bureaucracy was strewn with an acceptable level of corruption.
</p>
<p>
Systemic corruption worked for the RADICALS, too. It served to identify people
who weren’t doing it because of idealism, commitment, or principles. They were
the ambitious, doing it as a path to power or they were just angry and
frustrated and since they couldn’t get justice, they could at least grab a bit
of the wealth and power that’d otherwise go to the top.
</p>
<p>
The RADICAL’s learned the hard way to be careful, that if what you asked for
involved too much risk, you would be turned in for loyalty points. This had
happened to the Mayabeque Pod. Otherwise, corruption was a way for them to get
some things done. The people who were willing to turn a blind eye for a fee were
bringing value to them, so they’d put up Banners to pay for these…
contributions. And, yes, the RAD distribution system was very much operational,
although not as out in the open as it used to be. And not only with them, as
each old Pod learned how to corrode the Authority’s foundation, the Worms spread
the word with the other high-affinity Worms so they could keep learning from
each other.
</p>

<h2>The Authority</h2>
<p>
The Wormhole Engine high-affinity network was a major lever in eating away at
the Authority’s foundation. The RADICALS kept checking to make sure that there
was no leak for their Worms; one their biggest fear was that one of the Mirror
Worms had quietly infiltrated their network. But so far, everything was safe.
They were constantly leaking breadcrumbs, but nothing that would point to their
important work—they did it as an obfuscating tactic. When something leaked
through that could even become remotely suspicious, they would know who to bribe
to make the whole cloud of leaks go away quietly. Even if the Mirror agents were
paying attention, they would not know which breadcrumb, if any, was worth
following. So, they didn’t.
</p>
<p>
The RADICALS’s simulations could identify people who were taking bribes because
they were angry at the Authority. They did it as a way to “get some justice” out
of the system. About 37% of them fit this profile, and another 20-30% were
highly probable to fall in this “angry” category. That meant that about half of
the blind-eye people could eventually be potential supporters.
</p>
<p>
It seemed that the habitats were well ahead because they had Marines on their
side. They had proof without the Marines’ tools of violence, the Mirror agents
could transform in a relatively short time. This meant that it was possible to
unfang the Authority without shooting a bullet, to use the old expression. But
the habitats were a special case, very self-contained and far away from
Chairwoman Ping.
</p>
<p>
But… would it be possible to transform Chairwoman Ping?
</p>
