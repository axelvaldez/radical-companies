 <p>Co-ownership is profoundly transformative, evoking a sense of hope and possibility. This revolutionary concept marks the demise of oligarchic wealth and the birth of decentralized power. Gone are the days of toiling for a mere wage; instead, you will be rewarded based on the contributions you make. No longer will a traditional <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> owner hoard the wealth generated by your efforts. Instead, you will reap the wealth you helped create, enjoying an empowering and fulfilling experience.</p>
 <p>Co-ownership is probably the weirdest thing about the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Co-ownership is dynamic, based on the recognized contributions you get.</li>
   <li>Co-ownership is not a way to accumulate more wealth than the next person, because we are not competing, we are collaborating.</li>
   <li>Co-ownership is a way to get rewarded for contributions that are recognizable to your peer co-owners.</li>
   <li>Co-ownership is decentralized ownership: it is sustainable!</li>
   <li>Capital still has a role to play, but it doesn&rsquo;t get power over the company, the community.</li>
   <li>A co-owned company doesn&rsquo;t give out &ldquo;forever&rdquo; shares in exchange for capital. It doesn&rsquo;t have any to give..</li>
   <li></li>
  </ul>
 <p>So, what is the trick.</p>
