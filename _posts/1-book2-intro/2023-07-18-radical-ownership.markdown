 <p>Co-ownership is profoundly transformative, evoking a sense of hope and possibility. This revolutionary concept marks the demise of oligarchic wealth and the birth of decentralized power. Gone are the days of toiling for a mere wage; instead, you will be rewarded based on the contributions you make. No longer will a traditional <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> owner hoard the wealth generated by your efforts. Instead, you will reap the wealth you helped create, enjoying an empowering and fulfilling experience.</p>
 <p>Co-ownership is probably the weirdest thing about the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model,</p>
