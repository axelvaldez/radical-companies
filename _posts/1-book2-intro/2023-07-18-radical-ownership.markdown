<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership is profoundly transformative, evoking a sense of hope and possibility. This revolutionary concept marks the demise of oligarchic wealth and the birth of decentralized power. Gone are the days of toiling for a mere wage; instead, you will be rewarded based on the contributions you make. No longer will a traditional <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> owner hoard the wealth generated by your efforts. Instead, you will reap the wealth you helped create, enjoying an empowering and fulfilling experience.</p>
 <p>Co-ownership is the least understood thing about the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> paradigm. It is not a co-op and it is not revenue sharing. It is powerfully different. We&rsquo;ll get into the details of it below.</p>

<h1>RADs Instead of Shares</h1>
 <p>Before I go on, I need to explain what <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are.</p>
 <p>The name, <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s, is meaningless. It is the first name I could think of. But they are the key to decentralized ownership.</p>
 <p>We are used to &rdquo;somebody else,&rdquo; the boss, owning the business. <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s make it possible to have decentralized ownership, where you and your peers own the company. You are part of creating value and wealth, and with <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you are a co-owner of it.</p>
 <p>The value that you help create shows up as revenue, money paid for your good or services. With decentralized ownership, you are a co-owner of that revenue. Now &rdquo;somebody else&ldquo; owns it.</p>

<h1>Not Revenue Sharing</h1>
 <p>Revenue sharing is done according to that the boss says people are going to get. In the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based model, the system is decentralized and there is no boss to decide what you are going to get. Instead, your peers decide how many <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you get and you decide how many they get.</p>
 <p>The percentage of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you end up with determine what percentage of the revunue you get.</p>

<h1>Not a Co-op</h1>
 <p>Co-operatives make everybody financially equal. But people&rsquo;s contributions are not equal. The same person can contribute a lot one month, but less the next.</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are used to keep a tally of contributions.</p>
 
<h1>How RADs Work</h1>
 <p>Now we can talk about how <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s work.</p>
 <p>The whole thing starts with recognized contributions. As you doing your work, other co-owners will recognize some of it as <em>contributions that resonate with them</em> and they will record those using the <em><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s! mobile app</em> by simply pressing a button. The more signficant you find the contribution, the more button presses.</p>
 <p>At the end of the cycle (<em>e.g.</em>, a week, a month), the app calculates how many <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s those recognized contributions translate to. That many <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are given to each of the contributing co-owners.</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are cummulative, so each cycle adds to existing <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s.</p>
 
<h1>Shares Tired, RADs Wired</h1>
 <p>As I mentioned, <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based companies don&rsquo;t have shares. Ownership is based on recognized contributions, not capital</p>
 <p>Shares are a 16<sup>th</sup> century invention that worked pretty much as <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s, with one significant difference: shares are based on <em>capital</em> while <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are based on <em>recognized contributions</em>. But they are both ways to create something bigger than one person could.</p>
 <p>Business shares must have sounded crazy, like <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s sound today. The clientele for shares back then already were risk takers and it was a smaller audience. The audience for <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s is everybody who have been trained since birth to work for a wage and leave everything else to the oligarchic owners.</p>

<h1>Decentralized Ownership</h1>
 <p>Decentralized is sustainable. There is no </p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Co-ownership is dynamic</h1>
 <p>It is based on the recognized contributions you get.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>No Get-Rich-Quick Scheme</h1>
 <p>It is certainly not the way to accumulate more wealth than the next person. We are <em>not</em> competing, we are collaborating.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Rewards for Contributions</h1>
 <p>that are recognizable to your peer co-owners.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Capital</h1>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>But, I need capital. That is the normal way to get started!</span></p>
 <p>Capital still has a role to play, but it doesn&rsquo;t get power over the company, the community.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>No Forever Shares</h1>
 <p>A co-owned company doesn&rsquo;t give out &ldquo;forever&rdquo; shares in exchange for capital because it doesn&rsquo;t have any to give!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s the Catch?</h1>
 <p>What is the catch? Sounds like you want to pay people less!</p>
