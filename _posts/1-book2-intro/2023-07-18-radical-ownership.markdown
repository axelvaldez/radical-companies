<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Co-ownership is profoundly transformative, evoking a sense of hope and possibility. This revolutionary concept marks the demise of oligarchic wealth and the birth of decentralized power. Gone are the days of toiling for a mere wage; instead, you will be rewarded based on the contributions you make. No longer will a traditional <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> owner hoard the wealth generated by your efforts. Instead, you will reap the wealth you helped create, enjoying an empowering and fulfilling experience.</p>
 <p>Co-ownership is probably the least understood thing about the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> paradigm. It is not a co-op and it is not revenue sharing. It is powerfully different. We&rsquo;ll get into the detail of it in what follows.</p>

<h1>RADs Instead of Shares</h1>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>

<h1>Decentralized Ownership</h1>
 <p>It is sustainable.</p>
 <p></p>

<h1>Co-ownership is dynamic</h1>
 <p>It is based on the recognized contributions you get.</p>
 <p></p>

<h1>No Get-Rich-Quick Scheme</h1>
 <p>It is certainly not the way to accumulate more wealth than the next person. We are <em>not</em> competing, we are collaborating.</p>
 <p></p>

<h1>Rewards for Contributions</h1>
 <p>that are recognizable to your peer co-owners.</p>
 <p></p>

<h1>Capital</h1>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>But, I need capital. That is the normal way to get started!</span></p>
 <p>Capital still has a role to play, but it doesn&rsquo;t get power over the company, the community.</p>
 <p></p>

<h1>No Forever Shares</h1>
 <p>A co-owned company doesn&rsquo;t give out &ldquo;forever&rdquo; shares in exchange for capital because it doesn&rsquo;t have any to give!</p>
 <p></p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s the Catch?</h1>
 <p>What is the catch? Sounds like you want to pay people less!</p>
