<div style="display:none; ">
 <p>I think we know what the rHatchery is: We want to help <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses transform into healthy companies. And we are developing tools: the RADs! mobile app.</p>
</div>

<h1>RADs! Apps</h1>
 <p>Another tools that we are depolying is the RADs! app. In collaboration with Xipe Technology,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> we are about to launch a mobile app called <em>RADs!</em>.</p>
 <p>We talked about <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s in our book.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">2&nbsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>This app makes the Distribution process painless. It allows co-owners to recognize contributions and give <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s by pressing a button. They can presse this button as many times as they feel like it and the app figures out the amount of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to give.</p>
 <p>It also makes very easy to create and join as many communities as the co-owner wants.</p>

<h1>rCommunities</h1>
 <p>There is one more tool that we are using so far: <a href="https://radicalcompanies.com/2022/09/21/rtools-rcommunity-and-rcore" target="_blank">rCommunities</a>.</p>
