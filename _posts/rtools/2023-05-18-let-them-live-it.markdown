 <p>People have to experience non-<span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> and associate an emotion to it before they can love it (or hate it). The combination of the <em><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s!</em> mobile app so people can recognize contribution <em>and</em> the factoring of revenue through them will give people a chance to create an emotional attachement to <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s and the overall system. They <em>have to</em> experience co-ownership to realize the power of it.</p>
