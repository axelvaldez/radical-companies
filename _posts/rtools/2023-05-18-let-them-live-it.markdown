 <p>People have to experience an alternative to <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> and associate an emotion with it before they can love it (or hate it). The <em><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s!</em> mobile app serves that purpose,
  <ul>
   <li>It lets co-owners recognize contributions.</li>
   <li>From the recognized contribution, the app figures out the number of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s each co-owner gets.</li>
   <li>Revenue, for example, is factored throuh the <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s and make those contribitons tagible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <em><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s!</em> mobile app makes it possible for people to live and experience an alternative to <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span>.</p>
