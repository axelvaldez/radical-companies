<h1>They Are Not the Same</h1>
 <p>&ldquo;Equal&rdquo; assumes that everybody being treated financiall equally is enough. It seems to work for a while, but the it stops working. &ldquo;Equitable&rdquo; is based on contributions. It scales.</p>

<h1>By Committee</h1>
 <p>Let&rsquo;s say that the distribution is done by a boss or a committee. In the early days, with a small team, the boss or committee knows everybody and knows their work and they assign money, or stock, or whatever <em>equitably.</em> As the team grows, the boss or committee knows less and less of the new people as individuals. At that point, the distribution starts to get out of whack and they make up rules that lean towards equal.</p>
 <p>The old people notice and feel nostalgic. The next wave of people also notice and feel it&rsquo;s somewhat unfair. Maybe the old guys deserve it.&rdquo; The newest people also notice, feel unappreciated, and soon quit.</p>
 <p>This <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system doesn&rsquo;t scale mostly because it allows on one or a handful of benevolent people to make it bearable.</p>
 
<h1>Everybody a Co-Owner</h1>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">Radical</span>-based way is to have <em>everybody</em> recognize contributions <em>as they happen</em>. It makes everybody a co-owner in that it gives them the opportunity to give credit where they see it,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>New people join a team.</li>
   <li>They know everybody in the team and what each does.</li>
   <li>The team gets to know the new folks and what they do.</li>
   <li>Everybody gets to recognize contributions as they happen.</li>
   <li>As the community scales in size, co-owners in teams still know each other and can recognize contributions made my each.</li>
   <li>Co-owners will learn to communitcate more global contributions widely.</li>
  </ul>

    style="width:70%; margin-bottom:10px; "
    alt="">
  </div>
 
<h1>Contribution Recognitions</h1>
 <p>Contribution recognitions work like this,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Goes on all the time, not a quarter or a year later when memories get fuzzy.</li>
  <li>Are done by everybody, not just a small group.</li>
  <li>Each co-owner doesn&rsquo;t need to be angelical or even benevolent. She just needs to know enough about the people she is recognizing. She may not know his name, but she knows that he talked to somebody who was down in the dump and by the end of it their mood had visibly improved. And, yes, this is biased by her mood, whether or not she likes the other co-owner, etc. But other co-owners are biased as well in the other directions and overall they strike a much better balance than the one boss or a committee.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Each member, then, is a co-owner who gets to distribute the ownership of the company and its dividends to other co-owners. And they do it all the time, as they see those contributions happen.</p>
 <p>They can do this via the <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s! mobile app</em>.</p>

<h1>Giving RADs</h1>
 <p>Every co-owner gets one <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> per day and she gets to give them to other co-owners based on what feel like contributions to her. Different co-owners will get different amounts of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s from various other co-owners.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>We may end with this,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <img
    src="/assets/img/pic-equal-ne-equitable-04.svg"
    class="_center"
    style="margin-bottom:10px; "
   width="70%"
    alt="">
  </div>
 <p>Or with this,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/pic-equal-ne-equitable-05.svg"
   class="_center"
   style="margin-bottom:10px; "
   width="70%"
   alt="">
 </div>
 <p>Or even with this,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/pic-equal-ne-equitable-06.svg"
   class="_center"
   style="margin-bottom:10px; "
   width="70%"
   alt="">
 </div>
 <p>This distribution will most likely change again in future cycles as things change.<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>What Is a Contribution</h1>
 <p>In <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses contributions are about growing to the wealth of the business owners,</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>&ldquo;Owning a business is the fastest reliable way to wealth.&hellip; That&rsquo;s because once your business is established, you can earn more as the business grows without the need to work additional hours.&rdquo;<a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 </div>
 <p>In the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model, contributions add to the wellbeing of co-owners.</p>
