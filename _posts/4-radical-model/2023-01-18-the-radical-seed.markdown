<div style="display:none;">
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model includes a <span class="_paradigm">Foundation</span> and it is more like a seed than a tree. You do not know how it is going to develop.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model includes a <span class="_paradigm">Foundation</span> that is more like a seed. You do not know how it is going to develop. It doesn&rsquo;t specify the number of branches or the quality of the fruit that it will grow. But it will grow.</p>
 <p>We hope to be surprised by what others come up with.</p>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model revolves about its <span class="_paradigm">Foundation</span>,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <table class="_h2table">
    <tr>
     <th>Principles</th>
     <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Commitments</th>
     <td>Decentralization & Transparency</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Practices</th>
     <td>Experimentation</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </div>
 <p>How this is implemented will depend on each community. Will co-owners speak up when they are making a decision away from decentralization? Will they notice and say something about a decision that is taking them away from transparency? They are co-owners and it&rsquo;s up to them to shape the company.</p>

<h1>A Baby Tree</h1>
 <p>Like the tree that grows from the seed, you hope for the best, but they learn what they learn. Each will grow up differently depending on the co-owners..</p>
