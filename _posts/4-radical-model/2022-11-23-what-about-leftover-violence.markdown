 <p>What might it look like as we transition away from the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> way of doing things? Will violence keep us from moving through to <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span>?</p>

<h1>Intro</h1>
 <p>What might it look like as we transition away from the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> way of doing things?</p>
 <p>We have learned that in the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system <em>my success</em> requires that I&rsquo;d willing to wield violence against you. The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system requires violence, from the mildest to the most brutal shooting.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>Violence</h1>
 <p>What got me thinking about this was a comment made by our beach neighbor. One night she looked out her balcony window and saw two black pickups flanking the rental next door to ours. There were several armed people in the trucks and a loud party was going on inside the house.</p>
 <p>That sounded scary to me. What would I do if that had happened to me? Would I stay home? (No) Would I move away, to a hotel? (Yes). That is the choice we are going to face during a transitional period from our current system to a collaborative one.</p>
 <p>Most of them won&rsquo;t be as dramatic as people with guns, but there will be threats nevertheless.</p>

<h1>Learn from Each Other</h1>
 <p>Transparency may look scary at first. Some people will panic, and some even make dramatic exits. The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> skill is to learn from each other,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Learn about a different way of looking at these numbers that will make the fears go away.</li>
   <li>The fearful and the fearless will have something to contribute.</li>
   <li>Brainstorm the alternatives.</li>
   <li>In the end, the group will be a little <em>more</em> decentralized and transparent.</li>
   <li>Each person will be more capable of independent action.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>But&hellip; What about the Guns?</h1>
 <p>Not sure what to do about <em>people with guns.</em> Would I go down and talk to them? I don&rsquo;t think so. Would I do the superhero thing and swipe their weapons away with my cape? Nope.</p>
 <p>The <em>talk</em> is not with <em>people with weapons</em> but with <em>people with needs.</em> And it has to start way earlier.</p>
 <p>If the money came from selling drugs to addicted people the thing to so is help them getting the monkeys off their back. And not as a handout. Help them get out from under the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> pressures that lead to addiction in the first place.</p>
 <p>Get rid of <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> pressures and get rid of addiction and people with guns.</p>
