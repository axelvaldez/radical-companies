 <p>Co-ops people could easily switch to be based on the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model.</p>
 <p>It&rsquo;d be fairly straight forward to do by breaking the &ldquo;one person, one vote&rdquo; rule. They could then switch to a <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s-based to a system based on contributions, not equality.</p>

<h1>Pluses and Minuses of RADs</h1>
 <p>Ideally, the whole co-op that makes the switch, but most likely it will be individual co-op members,</p> 
 <ul>
  <li>You could give your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s yiels to a <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span>. For example, if somebody puts up a <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> to clean and beautify a nearby river walk, you could give the yield of some of your <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s to it.</li>
  <li>When somebody leaves the co-op, they take their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s with them. They earned them. So, they continue to get whatever is factored through these <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. However, they don&rsquo;t receive any new ones.</li>
  <li>Co-ops generally are managed by a <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> hierarchy. It still carries the presumption that the little people (most of us) need a boss (a selected few of them) to tell them what to do. That would be one impediment to switching.</li>
  <li>Another impediment would be the avoidance of change. But this changes over time, so we are not worries about it.</li>
 </ul>
