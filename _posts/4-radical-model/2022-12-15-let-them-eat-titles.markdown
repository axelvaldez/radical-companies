<h1>Titles?</h1>
 <p>The transition from <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> to <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> will not happen in a day. It&rsquo;s going to take time. In the meantime, some people will need to be able to tell what their <em>title</em> is. Some people have the confidence to just choose their own title, but others do not. So how do you assign titles in a <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> company?</p>

<h1>Gore & Associates</h1>
 <p>Some companies, like Gore Associates, the makers of <em>GoreTex</em> fabrics, just use <em>Associate</em> for everyone. Your coworkers are the people you literally <em>associate</em> with and it makes sense that Associate is a universal <em>title</em> in that environment. For the time being, When a person at Gore needed to speak to someone outside the organization, they would have a title to write down on a business card and make people from <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> businesses more comfortable.</p>

<h1>Nearsoft</h1>
 <p>This reminds me of a Nearsoft developer who really wanted an authority to give him a <em>title</em>. Nearsoft didn&rsquo;t have a <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> hierarchy, so it would have been easy enough to give himself a title. But this person insisted that a title be <em>given</em> to him.</p>
 <p>Later, talking to him, I found out that he consider a title an acknowledgement by by the co-managed Nearsoft. I said something like, <span class="_quotespan">Then you should have gone to your team! They are the &ldquo;authority&rdquo; on that kind of acknowledgement</span>. At that moment we realized that his appealing to me and me reacting as the authority was what got in the way. We are so blind to <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>; it is hard to resist falling back into it.</p>

<h1>A Social Need</h1>
 <p>Sure we can be the stewards of our identity, but we can not ignore that identity is also provided by our community<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>. If someone, Mailan, is a baker, people know he as &ldquo;Mailan the baker.&rdquo; If Mailan mostly yells, people around her expect that behavior because <span>that is the way she is</span>, that is her identity. If on the other hand they dont accept that behavior and she adapts, that is her identity.</p>
 <p>In a <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> world identity comes down from above: your boss gives you a title. This doesn&rsquo;t work in a <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> environment where the community reflects the qualities of the person; their work role is secondary, and can change.</p>

<h1>Disentangle</h1>
 <p>To decentralize, disentangle. In this case, how do we disentangle the boss&rsquo; function? how do we decentralize the power of assigning titles?</p>
 <p>One approach is to have everyone responsible for coming up with their own title, like they did at Nearsoft.</p>
 <p>Another way would be to have everyone who cares assign you a title. After everyone has put in their two cents, you will find you may have multiple titles. For example,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>If you are a developer, you might find that most people just call you a <em>Developer</em>.</li>
  <li>Others who have had you as a mentor may call you a <em>Senior Software Engineer</em> or even <em>Sensei</em>.</li>
  <li>The rest may call you an Engineer.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>At the end you are a person with many titles representing the many conceptions that your community have of you.</p>
 <p>This could happen once a year, or every six months. You might find that people identify you differently over time.</p>
 <p>If you really wanted that <em>Senior</em> part added to your title, then you would have to earn it with your community, and not just by kissing up to the boss.</p>
 <p>There probably are other ways, but the result will be a much richer and dynamic conception of identity. And it would offer an ability to interface with the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> world.</p>
