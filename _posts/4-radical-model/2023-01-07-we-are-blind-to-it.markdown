 <p>Today the problem is not the colonialism of distant lands. The BIG problem is the self-colonialism of our minds. It makes us blind to the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system we live in.</p>

<h1>Colonialism</h1>
 <p>There was the colonialism of distant lands. That was the big problem then. Today, the BIG problem today is the self-colonialism of our minds. It makes us blind to the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system we live in.</p>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>We assume that the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system is a forever thing and cannot be changed.</li>
  <li>We feel its impact, but can not see the source of it.</li>
  <li>The <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system remains invisible to us.</li>
  </li>

   style='float:left; '>
 </ul>
 <p>We did not even had a name for it, so we called it <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>.</p>

<h1>Radical Foundation</h1>
 <p>Rather than a systme where you have to remember rules and whatnots, we focused on an easy-to-remenber <span class="_paradigm">Foundation.</span> They also happen to be closer to the root of what we think it is important (<em>i.e.</em>, thus Radical).</p>

<h1>Co-Management</h1>
 <p>To start to move away from <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>, consider co-management,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>No bosses or employees</li>
   <li>Decentralized management: everybody is a co-manager</li>
   <li>The <em>RADs! mobile app</em></li>
   <li>Explicit relationships</li>
   <li>Explicit alignment</li>
   <li>Explicit profile</li>
  </ul>
 <p>But co-management is not enough. We also need co-ownership.</p>

<h1>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>Ownership is a human invention, a tool for living in society. <span class=<"_quotespan'>That is my tooth brush, but we can share the tooth paste.</span> The problem is that <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> ownership is <em>centralized</em>.</p>
 <p>Instead, consider co-ownership,</p>
  <li>Co-ownership is decentralized.</li>
  <li>Co-ownership is based on recognized contributions</li>
  <li>everybody who contributes is a co-owner</li>
  <li>There is a <em><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s! Mobile App</em> that helps you recognize contributions.</li>
  <li>the <em><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s! Mobile App</em> converts recognized contributions to <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span></span>s</li>
  <li><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s make contributions tangible.</li>
 </ul>
