<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Every time I talk about <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> and the co-ownership model a question always comes up that surprises me.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <div>The questions were about hiring. I tried to explain that my preference is that they'd be no hiring, per se. The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> system is set up for that. But to no avail,</div>
  <div class="_speakera">What do you do if you can&rsquo;t offer as much as the competition?</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">You don&rsquo;t have competition. You must be doing something different or else you should create an ensemble with &ldquo;the competition&rdquo;, or join them if you are working towards the the exact same impact.</div>
  <div class='_speakera'>You&rsquo;ll make money based on your contributions, that won&rsquo;t change. And you'll work faster.</div>
  <div class='_speakerb'>Absolute win, which is what you are describing, is what we know and it is Fiat thinking, for a world driven by capital: I win it all, you lose all. However, it is not the fastest way to have a broad impact in a world based on contributions.</div>
  <div class="_speakera">I don&rsquo;t understand. What if they steal my ideas?</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">OK, no&hellip; you cannot steal other people&rsquo;s ideas and they cannot [exaggerated air quotes] &ldquo;steal yours.&rdquo; Somebody else cannot copy you. They got the stuff that resonated with them, but that is it.</div>
  <p>He heard me, but&hellip; food for thought.</p>
  <div class="_speakerb">Back to the &ldquo;offer more money&rdquo; competition&hellip; let&rsquo;s say that these other people are completely <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>. All they know is that money works and they offered your candidate more than you. Time and time again, they &ldquo;win.&rdquo; It seems to me that those people that went for &ldquo;more money&rdquo; would not be aligned with you community. Keep looking until a candidates shows enough interest and curiosity; that is the candidate you want. One who wants to learn.  </div>
  <div class="_speakera">But what if she doesn't have the skills I need.</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">To make sure&hellip; this is person who knows how to program, right? But she doesn&rsquo;t know the specific language your team needs, is that it?</div>
  <div class="_speakera">Exactly!</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">And you don&rsquo;t think that she can learn a new language?</div>
  <div class="_speakera">Right! Well, no&hellip; yes, she can learn. But I need her to know that specific language the minute she walks in the door.</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">That sounds like bad planning on your part, right?&hellip; By the way, do you know how to program?</div>
  <div class="_speakera">Oh, sure&hellip;</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">And you were you born knowing all the programming languages, ever, rights?</div>
  <div class="_speakera">Of course not, but&hellip;</div>
  <div class="_speakerb">&hellip; then why not give her a chance to learn the new language. That is going to go a lot faster that learning co-management and co-ownership. Also, your team should explain what they need and she may even know somebody who can mentor her or she can propose another language that would be better suited to their needs.</div>
