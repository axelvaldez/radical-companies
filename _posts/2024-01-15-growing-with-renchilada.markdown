 <p>It is not &lsquo;breaking out&rsquo; or &lsquo;freedom.&rsquo; It is about growing the people and the community (<em>aka.</em>, the company).</p>
</div>

<h1>Ownership is Freeing</h1>
  <ul>
   <li>Fiat ownership applies to the <em><strong>a handful of people who put up capital</strong> to own the business.</em></li>
   <li>Co-ownership aappplies to <em><strong>everyone who contributes</strong> to a company.</em></li>
  </ul>

<h1>Jose Contreras</h1>
 <p>An example of contributin is Jose Contreras, a friend and co-owner of rEnchilada.</p>
 <p>He has an interesting background,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>He spent time in prison</li>
   <li>He was the first employee of Nearsoft, a business that I had co-founded.</li>
   <li>From Nearsoft he went on to work for well-known, big companies.</li>
   <li>He writes poetry and has a facility with words.</li>
   <li>He is very creative and very qick on his feet.</li>
   <li>He came up with what became the <em>rEnchilada</em> to help people.</li>
  <ul>

<h1>Staffing</h1>
  <p>rEnchila is going to staff up with underrepresented people as co-owners (<em>e.g.</em>, brown and black people, single mothers, ex-felons, etc).</p>
 
<h1>rEnchilada</h1>
 <p>Jose&rsquo;s idea was to unify the sales evidence-based process into a Sales Stac. That leads to revenue growth with minimal fuzz and less expensive than hiring a Sales team.</p>
 <p>Our teaam,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Gets leads</li>
  <li>Our Sales Development Reps (SDRs) calls these leads or emails them.</li>
  <li>We qualify a few as <span class="iquo">ready to buy now.</span></li>
 </ul>
 <p>Big companies may do all of this in-house without a process. Smaller companies contract for each piece. But there is still no process problem. Jose&rsquo;s idea is to unify all of that into a single flow process. We work this process and then we work with our cstomers so they canlearn it.</p>

<h1>But…</h1>
 <p class="iquo">… somebody must be doing it already!</p>
 <p>That my first reaction, but I did some research and I came up empty handed. I talked to some of my friends in Sales and they pointed out that even in big companies there is no process. Sales is a sink or swim activity and what goes is whatever the sales people learned in their previous job.</p>
 <p>Sales people have to make their financial quotas, and tnat is the only thing that is measured.</p>
