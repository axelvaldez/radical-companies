<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Investing for your own wellbeing, the wellbeing of your community, and for the bucks&hellip; in that order.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The two women walking in front of me were talking about what they wished existed,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>They had extra money but they didn&rsquo;t dare invest.</li>
   <li>They wish they could pool their money with others to make a difference to their communities.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>The woman on my left pointed out that this could be &ldquo;somebody you know, preferably a family member&rdquo;, &ldquo;But,&rdquo; responded the one on my right, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anybody like that!&rdquo; Left woman laughed and said, &ldquo;Well, neither do I.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>A bit later, left woman brought up &ldquo;community&rdquo; and right woman said, &ldquo;yes, I wish I knew where my money went. The big funds end up investing in things I don&rsquo;t want to promote. They may not even know because it is a business that owns a business that owns a business that is selling vaporizers.&rdquo; And, oh, the irony, she said just as she was waling in front of a store that sold vaporizers. In any case, they walked ahead as I got to my destination.</p>
