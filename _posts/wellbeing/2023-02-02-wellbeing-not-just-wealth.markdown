<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Investing for your own wellbeing, the wellbeing of your community, and for the bucks&hellip; in that order.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>The two women walking in front of me were talking about <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investing. At least, they were talking about they wished existed. They were talking about two things,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>They had extra money but they didn&rsquo;t dare invest, at least traditional investments.</li>
   <li>They wish they could pool their money with others to make a difference to their communities.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>One pointed out that this could be &ldquo;somebody you know, preferably a family member&rdquo;, &ldquo;But,&rdquo; responded the other, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anybody like that!&rdquo; The other laughed and said, &ldquo;Well, neither do I.&rdquo;
