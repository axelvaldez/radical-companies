 <p>The two women walking in front of me were talking about what they wished existed. They seem to have money they could invest, but they didn&rsquo;t dare invest. The woman on my left pointed out that the woman on the right invest in &ldquo;somebody you know&hellip; a family member?&rdquo;, &ldquo;But,&rdquo; responded the one on my right, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anybody like that!&rdquo; Left woman laughed and said, &ldquo;Well, neither do I. And I don&rsquo;t have that much money, either.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>A bit later, left woman brought up &ldquo;community&rdquo; and right woman said, &ldquo;yes, right, I wish I knew where my money went. The big funds end up investing in things I don&rsquo;t want to promote. They may not even know because it is a business that owns a business that owns a business that is selling some crap like vaporizers.&rdquo; And, oh, the irony: she said this just as she was walking in front of a store that sold vaporizers, and worse. In any case, they walked ahead as I got to my destination.</p>
