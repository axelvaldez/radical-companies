<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Investing for your own wellbeing, the wellbeing of your community, and for the bucks. In that order.</p>
</div>

<h1>Left and Right</h1>
 <p>The two people walking in front of me were talking about what they wished existed. They seem to have some money to invest, but they didn&rsquo;t dare do so. The person on my left suggested to the one my right to invest in &ldquo;somebody you know, maybe someone in your family?&rdquo;</p>
 <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; responded right person, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anybody like that!&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Left person laughed and said, &ldquo;Well, neither do I. And I don&rsquo;t have that much to invest, either.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>A bit later, left person brought up &ldquo;community&rdquo; and right person said, &ldquo;yes, right, I wish I knew where my money went. The big funds end up investing in things I don&rsquo;t like. They invest in a clean business, but it owns another business and it owns another business that sells some crap like vaporizers.&rdquo; And, oh, the irony: she said this just as they were walking in front of a store that sold <em>CBT vapes</em>.</p>
 <p>A bit later they walked ahead as I got to my where I was going.</p>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> Investments</h1>
 <p>As they were talking I kept thinking of that <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investments addressed their issues. <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investments fail like investments (<em>i.e.</em> if the company does not make it, the money is gone), but they look like loans in that you get a return on your money. The latter could range from a percentage of the investment amount to a percentage of revenue for some time. No matter, there are no shares and you don&rsquo;t any other powers over the company. This sounds a lot like what is commonly known as a friends-family-and-fools investment, the foundation of which is trust.</p>
 <p>The foundation of a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investment is trust as well. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; the counter goes, &ldquo;there is not enough trust in the world to fund all the unicorns that are coming up.&rdquo; Indeed, many of these have lost their horn and are no longer unicorns. In any case, those are capital investements, purely for wealth. Whether or not they contribute to the health of the community don&rsquo;t matter, these investments are made exclusively to generate wealth. <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investments are made to generate wellbeing, and some wealth.</p>

<h1>Wellbeing Comes First</h1>
 <p>Wealth generation almost invariably comes at the cost of wellbeing of the founders, that of the &ldquo;ground floor&rdquo; employees, and the wellbeing of the community as well. As one upset Board member put it, &ldquo;Your job is to leverage our investment. Otherwise, you are not going to get anything for all the effort you and your crew are putting in!&rdquo; Scary words which you take as a warning that you&rsquo;d better listen to and do what you have to do to &ldquo;leverage their investment&rdquo;, even if it costs you your wellbeing, your family&rsquo;s, and that of you &ldquo;your crew&rdquo; (<em>i.e.</em>, your friends).</p>
 <p>From that perspective, the wellbeing of your community does not count. And as we now know, the wellbeing of our environment, our life support system, has been the loser as we chase wealth generation.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investments do not put that kind of pressure (<em>i.e.</em>, force) on co-owners. <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investments just are a practice supported by the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> system. They are more robust, long lasting, and make the odds of financial sucess higher. And all of this without the cost to wellbeing to companies or their communities.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>
