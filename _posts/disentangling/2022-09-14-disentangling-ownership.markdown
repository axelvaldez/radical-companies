  <p>Business ownership is really simple: owners keep the profits. And since ownerships is good, everbody should be a co-owner so they can equitably, not equally, share the profits.</p>
</div>

<h1>Businesses & Companies</h1>
 <p>There are various types of ownership. One type of ownership is personal and another type is business ownership. Personal ownership has to do with depreciating assets: houses, cars, and coffee cups. Business ownership has to do with active assets. One or a few people own the profits that come out of the business.</p>
 <p>Whether it is a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or any type of corporation (<em>i.e.</em>, including Cooperatives and B Corps), the profits generated by active assets belong to their owners. Private business are the only option we have today: you either own a business (and its profits) or you are working for paycheck. We call <em>all of these</em> <a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> businesses, because everything is done by the absolute say so of the owner(s).</p>
 <p> businesses are hierarchical. They can be generous and progressive, like Patagonia, but, no matter, their overarching goal is to make profits for its owners.</p>

<h1>An Alternative</h1>
 <p>An alternative to the pervasive FIAT business model is what we call <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>></p>
 <p>Notice that we differentiate “businesses” from “companies.” Business, in the sense of manufacturing and trading, is what owners do to create profits for themselves. Company comes from the Latin prefix con- and the word pan, bread. Company then refers to people who break bread together. So, we talk about  businesses and <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies as two distinct species of the same genus. Like donkeys and zebras.</p>

<h1>Disentangling Ownership</h1>
 <p>Like  businesses, <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies are private. They are not owned by a benevolent-government-in-the-name-of-the-people and they are not cooperatives.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies are owned by what we call co-owners. Instead of it belonging to one or a few people, they are co-owned by everybody who embodies it.</p>
 <p>Instead of a static number of shares, ownership of a <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> company is dynamic. It changes based on contributions recognized by other co-owners.</p>
 <p>Instead of one or a handful of people, you and the other co-owners own the surplus value (<em>i.e.</em>, the profits) that you all create.</p>
