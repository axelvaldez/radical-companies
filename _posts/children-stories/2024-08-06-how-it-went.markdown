 <p>Their story continues&hellip;</p>
</div>

<h1>Progress?</h1>
 <p>The Fiat House had more and more Beings in its shack and over many years they had to build a much bigger House. The Beings who lived itn it tried calling themselves Chieftains, Kings, but as the House became more prosperous they just called themselves CEOs.</p>
 <p>Every one of the Beings who lived the House adored Fiat, the Biggest Boss. The ones who did not adore the Biggest Boss had to move to the shack. Ufortunately, the shack fallen badly into disrepair aand was falling-apart.</p>

<h1>The Riff-Raff</h1>
<p>Actually, the Beings who lived in the shack were the riff-raff, and none of the Fiat House Beings cared about them. Somebody had to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities. They could no just go.</p>
 <p>The Beings in the shack were so stupid that they even tried to help Beings. They obbvoiusly did not know what everybody knows: the riff-raff in the shack were stupid and could not be helped.</p>
 <p>The Beings who had fallen out of grace were the perfect replacements for the riff-raff that had fallen back to pieces.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
 <p>All Beings, in and out of the Fiat House felt the impact of the Fiat House. but,  no matter, Fiat had built the perfect House.</p>
 <p>Everything that that they tried to change eventually became part of it,</p>

 <p>It seems that Fiat House was good at absorbing all that got in its way.</p>
 <p>And the time came and went. And an eagle flew by. And the times changed.</p>

<h1>Things Changed</h1>
 <p>Radical came together from pieces on the floor left by others as they came apart.</p>
 <p>It felt the impact right away. It knew that it was coming from the Fiat House, so he went over there to talk to them. But Fiat did not want to talk to Radical to it and the others spokein circles and tried to confuse it.</p>
 <p>He found that strange, Beings that did not want to talk. What the&hellip;?</p>

<h1>Listen!</h1>
 <p>Radical talked to the Beings in the Foundation House and learned that every time they tried they were beaten back, with volence, something they had nver seen among Beings</p>

<h1>The Radical Foundation</h1>
 <p>Radical thought and thought and finally came out with a simple Foundation. He knew that people needed time, he knew that they had different cultures. He knew that they would want to have something that they could change, not dogma.</p>
 <p>But Radical also knew the danger of Fiat absorbing the Foundation. So the Foundation had to be simple and easy to remember. It was important that Beings could ask one another how their proposal compared with the Foundation.</p>
 <p>the problem in the past is that a lot of Beings could identify the problems, but they had forgotten to point out a specific solution as an example. And so the Radical Foundation came together,
 <p>You can build a one-story house or a 20-story building on it, <em>so long as it does not go against the five Foundation tenets</em>,</p>

 <p>If the proposal goes against the fundamemtal tenents of Radical, then it is a Fiat organizatiomn, and that kis OK, too, if the co-owners agree to it and do not walk away.</p>
