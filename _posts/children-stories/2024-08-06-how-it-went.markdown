 <p>Their story continues&hellip;</p>
</div>

<h1>Progress?</h1>
 <p>The Fiat House had more and more Beings in its shack and over many years they had to build a much bigger House. The Beings who lived itn it tried calling themselves Chieftains, Kings, but as the House became more prosperous they just called themselves CEOs.</p>
 <p>Every one of the Beings who lived the House adored Fiat, the Biggest Boss. The ones who did not adore the Biggest Boss had to move to the shack. Ufortunately, the shack fallen badly into disrepair aand was falling-apart.</p>

<h1>The Riff-Raff</h1>
<p>Actually, the Beings who lived in the shack were the riff-raff, and none of the Fiat House Beings cared about them. Somebody had to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities. They could no justt&hellip; go.</p>
 <p>The Beings in the shack were so stupid that they even tried to help Beings. They obbvoiusly did not know what everybody knows: the riff-raff in the shack were stupid and could not be helped.</p>
 <p>The Beings who had fallen out of grace were the perfect replacements for the riff-raff that had fallen back to pieces.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
 <p>All Beings, in and out of the Fiat House felt the impact of the Fiat House. but,  no matter, Fiat had built the perfect House.</p>
 <p>Everything that that they tried to change eventually became part of it,</p>

 <p>It seems that House that Fiat came up with was good at absorbing all that got in its way.</p>
 <p>And the time went by. And the times changed.</p>

<h1>Things Changed</h1>
 <p>Radical came together from pieces on the floor left by others as they came apart.</p>
 <p>It felt the impact right away. It knew that it was coiming from the Fiat House. So he went over there with the intention of taling to them. But Fiat did not want to talk to it and everybody else was tring to confuse it.</p>
 <p>He found that strange, Beings that did not want to talk. What the&hellip;?</p>

<h1>Listen!</h1>
 <p>Radical talked to the Beings in the Foundation House and learned that every time tney tried they were beating back, something they had nver seen among Beings</p>
