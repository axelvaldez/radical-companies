 <p>How the story ended up. For now.</p>
</div>

<h1>Decentralization & Transparency</h1>
 <p>Decentralization and Transparency always came and went together. They held hands, too, like good friends.</p>

<h1>Decentralization</h1>
  <div class="_illustration">Impish character.</div>
 <p>Decentralization did not like rules that applied to everybody, against their wills. It just didnt like the effect it had on Itsums. It liked to get to the roots of things. It liked making Itsums capable of making and changing their own rules.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;<em>But it will be chaos</em>,&rdquo; they yelled louder and louder from the Fiat House. &ldquo;<em>So idealistic for Pete&rsquo;s sake!</em>.&rdquo; (That is what they always say to instill fear).</p>
 <p>What they do not say is that it may be that way, <strong><em>if</em></strong> your livelihood and autonomy, depends of it. But it does not have to be that way.</p>
 <p>In the Radical House Itsums do everything as an <em>experiment</em> and they either get it done, so that it stops being &ldquo;idealistic&rdquo;, or Itsums learn how not to do it.</p>

<h1>Transparency</h1>
  <div class="_illustration">Impish character with a dialog bubble that says "INADVERTENT SECRETS."</div>
 <p>Transparency went around reminding Itsums to not keep secrets and to let it all hang out. If it existed, others must find out about it. No trade secrets. No trademarks. No Non-Disclosures Agreements. No secrets whatsoever. Except inadvertent secrets. And that is why Transparency went around reminding Itsums to bring their <em>inadvertent secrets</em> out into the sunshine.</p>
 <p>There were lots of questions and it sure was a lot of work to answer those questions, but it was worth it. In fact, sometimes answering a question suggested an improvement or a better way to explaining it, and that was satisfying.</p>

<h1>Speaking of RADs</h1>
 <p>In the Fiat House a strategy usually came from the Bosses. In the Foundation House RADs replaced the Bosess. That id becase in the Radical House Itsums gave RADs to each other so there is no need for Bosses.</p>
 <p>RADs is how things are distributed at the Radical House. Candy, money, food, etc., were all distributed through RADs. The more RADs you have the more you get.</p>

 <p>(The <em>RADs! mobile app</em> is available in te Apple and Google <em>App Stores</em>)</p>
