 <p>How the story ended up. For now.</p>
</div>

<h1>Decentralization & Transparency</h1>
 <p>Decentralization and Transparency always came and went together. They always held hands, like good friends.</p>

<h1>Decentralization</h1>
 <p>Decentralization did not like one-for-all rules. It just didnt lke it what it did to Itsum.</p>
 <p>It liked to get to the roots of things. It allowed the Itsum to make up their own rules of top of it if they want to or change them.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;<em>It will be chaos</em>,&rdquo; they yelled louder and louder from the Fiat House, &ldquo;<em>So idialistic for Pete&rsquo;s sake!</em>.&rdquo; That is what they always say to instill fear.</p>
 <p>What they do not say is that it may be that way <strong><em>if</em></strong> your livelihood depends of it, your autonomy. In the Radical House, however, Itsums do everhything as an experiment. We either get it done so that it stopped being &ldquo;idealistic,&rdquo; or we learn how not to do it.</p>
 <p>(A failed experiment, in fact, may be deserving of RADs.)</p>

<h1>Transparency</h1>
 <p>Transparency went around reminding Itsum to let all hang out. If it it existed, others must know about it.</p>
 <p>No trade secrets. No trademarks. No NDAs. No secrets whatsoever. Except inadvertent secrets. And that was Transparency&rsquo;s passion. That is why he went around remindig Itsum to bring their inadvertent secrets to the light.</p>
 <p>Sure it was a lot of work to answer the questions, but it was worth it. Sometimes answering a suggested an improvement brought about othere ideas and made it very worth it and satisfyig.</p>

<h1>A Lot of Work</h1>
 <p>As the Radical House grew. Later they will be more Itsum to answer questions, but for now it was all up to Decentralization and Transparency, and theyn loved it!</p>

<h1>Speaking of RADs</h1>
 <p>A mission wants a strategy and usually that comes from the Bosses in the Fiat House.</p>
 <p>In the Radical House <em>RADs did it</em>. The Itsum gave RADs to each other so there was no need for a Boss. And RADs is how things are distributed at the Radical House. Candy, food, etc., all distributed through RADs.</p>

<h1>The Foundation</h1>

 <p>It points to a something that is easy to remember and technically easy to implement.</p>
