 <p>Their story ended up. For now.</p>

<h1>Decentralization & Transparency</h1>
 <p>Decentralization and transparency held hands as friends that they were.</p>

<h1Decentralization</h1>
 <p>Decentralization did not like one-for-all rules. It just didnt lke it what it did to Itsum.</p>
 <p>It liked to get to the roots of things. It allowed the Itsum to make up their own rules of top of it if they want to or change them.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;<em>It will be chaos</em>,&rdquo; they yelled louder and louder from the Fiat House, &ldquo;<em>Idialistic for Pete&rsquo;s sake!</em>,&rdquo; That is what they always say to instill fear.</p>
 <p>What they do not say is that it may be that way if your livelihood depends of it. In the Radical House, however, we do everhything as an experiment. We either get it done or we learn.</p>
 <p>In fact, a failed experiment may be deserving of RADs.</p>
