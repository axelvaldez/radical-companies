 <p>How the story ended up. For now.</p>
</div>

<h1>Decentralization & Transparency</h1>
 <p>Decentralization and Transparency always came and went together. They held hands, too, like good friends.</p>

<h1>Decentralization</h1>
 <p>Decentralization did not like rules that applied to everybody, against their wills. It just didnt like the efect it had on Itsums.</p>
 <p>Decentralization liked to get to the roots of things. It liked making Itsums capable of making and changing their own rules. &ldquo;<em>But it will be chaos</em>,&rdquo; they yelled louder and louder from the Fiat House. &ldquo;<em>So idealistic for Pete&rsquo;s sake!</em>.&rdquo; That is what they always said to instill fear.</p>
 <p>What they do not say is that <em>it may be that way,</em> <strong><em>if</em></strong> your livelihood and autonomy, depends of it. But it does not have to be that way.</p>
 <p>For example, in the Radical House Itsums do everything as an <em>experiment</em> and they either get it done, so that it stops being &ldquo;idealistic&rdquo; or Itsums learn how not to do it.</p>

<h1>Transparency</h1>
 <p>Transparency went around reminding Itsums to let it all hang out. If it existed, others must know about it.</p>
 <p>No trade secrets. No trademarks. No Non-Disclosures Agreements. No secrets whatsoever. Except inadvertent secrets. And that was Transparency&rsquo;s passion.</p>
 <p>That is why Transparency went around reminding Itsums to bring their <em>inadvertent secrets</em> out to the sunshine.</p>
 <p>There were lots of questions and it sure was a lot of work to answer the questions, but it was worth it. In fact, sometimes answering a question suggested an improvement. And that was worth it and satisfying.</p>
 <p>Later there will be more Itsums to answer questions, after they lived it, but for now it was all up to Decentralization and Transparency, and they loved it!</p>

<h1>Speaking of RADs</h1>
 <p>In the Fiat House a strategy usually came from the Bosses. In the Foundation House <em>RADs did it</em>, they replaced the Boss.</p>
 <p>In the Radical House the Itsums gave RADs to each other so there was no need for Bosses. RADs is how things are distributed at the Radical House. Candy, food, etc., were all distributed through RADs.</p>

<h1>The Foundation</h1>

 <p>This is easy to remember and technically easy and keep you on track.</p>
