 <p>Their story ended up. For now.</p>

<h1>Decentralization & Transparency</h1>
 <p>Decentralization and transparency held hands as friends that they were.</p>

<h1Decentralization</h1>
 <p>Decentralization did not like one-for-all rules. It just didnt lke it wnat kt dkd to people. It liked to get to the roots of things so that the Itsum could make up their own rules if they want to or change them.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;<em>It will be chaos</em>,&rdquo; they yelled louder and louder from the Fiat House, &ldquo;<em>Idialistic for Pete&rsquo;s sake!</em>,&rdquo; That is what they always say to still fear</p>
 <p>What they do not say is that it may be that way if your livelihood depends of it. But in the Radical House we do everhything as an experiment. We either get it done or we learn.</p>
 <p>In fact, a failed experiment may be deserving of a RADs or many.</p>
