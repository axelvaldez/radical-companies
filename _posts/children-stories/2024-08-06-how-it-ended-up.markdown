 <p>Their story ended up. For now.</p>
</div>

<h1>Decentralization & Transparency</h1>
 <p>Decentralization and transparency held hands as friends that they were.</p>

<h1>Decentralization</h1>
 <p>Decentralization did not like one-for-all rules. It just didnt lke it what it did to Itsum.</p>
 <p>It liked to get to the roots of things. It allowed the Itsum to make up their own rules of top of it if they want to or change them.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;<em>It will be chaos</em>,&rdquo; they yelled louder and louder from the Fiat House, &ldquo;<em>Idialistic for Pete&rsquo;s sake!</em>,&rdquo; That is what they always say to instill fear.</p>
 <p>What they do not say is that it may be that way if your livelihood depends of it. In the Radical House, however, we do everhything as an experiment. We either get it done or we learn.</p>
 <p>In fact, a failed experiment may be deserving of RADs.</p>

<h1>Transparency</h1>
 <p>Transparency went around reminding Itsum to let all hang out. It it existed, others should know about it.</p>
 <p>No trade secrets. No trademarks. No NDAs. No secrets whatsoever. Except inadvertent secrets. And that was Transparency&rsquo;s passion. That is why he went around remindig Itsum to let the inadvertent secrets find their way to the light.</p>
 <p>Sure it was a lot of work making time to amswer all the questions. But it was worth it. For example, sometimes answering a question suggested an improvement. It made t worth it.</p>


<h1>A Lot of Work</h1>
 <p>As the Radical House grew this was a lot of work. Later they will be more Itsum to answer questions, but for now it was all up to Decentralization and Transparency. And theyn loved it!</p>

<h1>Speaking of RADs</h1>
 <p>A mission wants a strategy and usually that comes from the Bosses in the Fiat House.</p>
 <p>In the Radical House RADs did it. The Itsum gave RADs to each other so there was no need for a Boss.</p>
 <p>RADs is how things are distributed at the Radical House. Candy, food, etc., all distributed through RADs.</p>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>And that is the Foundation,
