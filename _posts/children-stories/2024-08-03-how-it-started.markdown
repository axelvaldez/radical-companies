 <p>Meaning is wat you would a deep introvert.</p>
</div>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
 <p>Meaning and Belonging always come and go together. They always hold hands, like good friends.</p>
 <p>They were friends with Fiat.</p>

<h1>Belonging</h1>
 <p>Belonging is a friend of Meaning and Fiat. Belonging is defintely an extrovert. It enjoys others, even when they disagree because it learns a lot from disagreements. He listens well like all the Itsums.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;<em>It was long time ago</em>,&rdquo; said Belonging, &ldquo;<em>when I met Meaning first and Fiat after that</em>.&rdquo;.</p>
 <p>They did not know back then how much Fiat would impact them.</p>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>Fiat was a friend back then of Meaning and Belonging. It came together from the pieces on the floor, like Itsums do. But it had a preference for pieces with sharp edges.</p>
 <p>Meaning, Belonging, and all the Itsums had the ability to change as they deeply listened. But Fiat&rsquo;s morphing abilities were very something else.
 <p>All the Itsums picked up pieces of love as they came together, but not Fiat.</p>

<h1>How It Started</h1>
 <p>Fiat turned out to be very divisive. It all started when it moved out of the Foundation house with Fear and Threat;. They all had also very little love in them.</p>
 <p>Then Violence came together in the Fiat house and things really bad.</p>
 <p>As the Fiat House grew, the Foundation House almost dissapeared, but feelings and vague memoreis remained.</p>
 <p>Then Radical built a little Foundation Shack, and that is where it lived with friends Meaning, Belonging, Decentralization, Transparency, and Experimentation.</p>

<h1>How It Ended Up</h1>
 <p>All ended well. But it took a long time and a lot of tears.</p>
