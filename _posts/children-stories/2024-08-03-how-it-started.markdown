 <p>Meaning is the shortest of who live in a house called Foundation. It is also the one that stands higher. I think it is what you call an introvert.</p>
 <p>Belonging is a friend of Meaning. It is defintely an extrovert. It enjoys others, even when they disagree, because it learns a lot from disagreements.</p>

<h1>Meaning and Belonging</h1>
 <p>Meaning and Belonging always come and go together. They always hold hands, like good friends.</p>
 <p>Meaning remains quiet until it finds others and the he blossoms. It lives atop and deep inside and it sees all there is and he chooses where it belongs. That is how it found Belonging and Fiat.</p>
 <p>Meaning becomes stronger when it is supported by others, like Belonging and Fiat. Belonging becomes happier when it finds supporting beings like Meaning and Fiat.</p>

<h1>Belonging</h1>
 <p>&ldquo;<em>It was long time ago,</em>&rdquo; said Belonging, &ldquo;<em>when I met Meaning and Fiat</em>.&rdquo; They were all very good friends, Meaning, Belonging, and Fiat. They did not know back then how much Fiat would impact their lives.</p>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>Fiat came together from only the pieces on the floor. Sharp pieces.</p>
 <p>He had a way of morphing: we all saw different shapes of it. Meaning, Belonging, and all the beings had the ability to change as they deeply listenedn but Fiat&rsquo;s morphing abilities were something else.</p>
 <p>By the way, all the beings picked up pieces of love as they formed, but Fiat did not.</p>

<h1>How It Started</h1>
 <p>Fiat turned out to be very divisive.</p>
 <p>It all started when it moved out of the Foundation house with Fear and Threat; they had also very little love in them.</p>
 <p>The violence move into the the Fiat house and things really bad. The Foundation house dissapeared for hundreds of years. But Radical built a little Foundation shack, and that is where it lived with Love. They even encouraged the coming together of Coowner.</p>

<h1>How It Ended</h1>
 <p>Radical came to the rescue and all ended well, after a lot of tears.</p>
