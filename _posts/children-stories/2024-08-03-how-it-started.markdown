<div style='display:none; '>
 <p>Meaning is the shortest of who live in a house called Foundation. It is also the one that stands higher. I think it is what you call an introvert.</p>
</div>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
 <p>Meaning and Belonging always come and go together. They always hold hands, like good friends.</p>
 <p>Fiat had a way of morphing so that every Being saw different shapes of it. Meaning, Belonging, and all the Beings had the ability to change as they deeply listenedn, but Fiat&rsquo;s morphing abilities were something else.</p>
 <p>Maybe it was because Fiat had not picked up pieces of love as it came togetner. Come tp think of it, it had only pickedm upm sharp shards.</p>

<h1>Belonging</h1>
 <p>Belonging is a friend of Meaning and Fiat. Belonging is defintely an extrovert. It enjoys others, even when they disagree because it learns a lot from disagreements. He listens well like all the Beings.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;<em>It was long time ago</em>,&rdquo; said Belonging, &ldquo;<em>when I met Meaning first and Fiat after that</em>.&rdquo; They were all very good friends, Meaning, Belonging, and Fiat.</p>
 <p>They did not know back then how much Fiat would impact them.</p>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>Fiat came together from  the pieces on the floor, lkke Beings do. But he picked pieces with sharp edges.</p>
 <p>He had a way of morphing so that others saw different shapes of it. Meaning, Belonging, and all the Beings had the ability to change as they deeply listenedn. But Fiat&rsquo;s morphing abilities were very strange. They were something else.
 <p>All the Beings came together by picked up pieces of love as they formed. Bit Fiat was very selective.</p>

<h1>How It Started</h1>
 <p>Fiat turned out to be very divisive.</p>
 <p>It all started when it moved out of the Foundation house with Fear and Threat; they had also very little love in them.</p>
 <p>The violence move into the the Fiat house and things really bad. The Foundation house dissapeared for hundreds of years. But Radical built a little Foundation shack, and that is where it lived with Love. They even encouraged the coming together of Coowner.</p>

<h1>How It Ended Up</h1>
 <p>Radical came to the rescue and all ended well, after a lot of tears.</p>
