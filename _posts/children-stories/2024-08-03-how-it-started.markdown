 <p>Meaning is what you would call a deep introvert.</p>
</div>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
 <div class="_illustration">Impish character happily hiding inside a normal human brain.</div>
 <p>Meaning and Belonging always came and went together. They always held hands, like good friends.</p>
 <p>They were friends with Fiat.</p>

<h1>Belonging</h1>
 <p>Belonging is a friend of Meaning and Fiat.</p>
  <div class="_illustration">Impish character, very happy interacting with others.</div>
 <p>Belonging is definitely an extrovert. It enjoys others, even when they disagree because it learns a lot from disagreements.</p>
  <div class="_illustration">Show Meaning and Belonging holding hands while Fiat is not. In fact, Fiat is a bit separated from them.</div>
 <p>He listens well, like all the Itsums. &ldquo;<em>It was long time ago</em>,&rdquo; said Belonging, &ldquo;<em>I met Meaning first and Fiat later</em>.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>They did not know back then how much Fiat would impact them.</p>
  <br />
  <div class="_illustration">Text will wrap around illustrations.</div>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
  <div class="_illustration">Partially completed Fiat&mdash; you can see some of his face and some of his legs and sharp pieces levitating from the floor.</div>
 <p>Fiat came together from the pieces on the floor, like Itsums do. All the Itsums picked up pieces of love as they came together, but not Fiat.</p>
 <p>But it had a preference for pieces with sharp edges. Meaning, Belonging, and all the Itsums had the ability to change as they deeply listened. But Fiat&rsquo;s morphing abilities were something else.</p>

<h1>How It Started</h1>
 <p>Fiat turned out to be very divisive. It got worse when it moved out of the Foundation House with Fear and Threat.</p>
 <p>All three of them had also very little love in them. Then Violence came together and things got really much worse for most Itsums.</p>
  <div class="_illustration">Small and shrinking Foundation House next to a bit bigger and growing Fiat House.</div>
 <p>As the Fiat House grew, the Foundation House almost dissapeared.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
  <div class="_illustration">Radical being held up by Meaning & Belonging, Decentralization & Transparency, and Experimentation.</div>
 <p>Radical came together in the Foundation House. It lived there with Meaning, Belonging, Decentralization, Transparency, and Experimentation.</p>
 <p>They did not know at the time how much Radical would impact them.</p>

<h1>How It Ended Up</h1>
 <p>All ended well. The Foundation House grew again and Fiat now had a neighbor. It was not easy and it took a long time and tears, but Fiat now had an alternative next door.</p>
