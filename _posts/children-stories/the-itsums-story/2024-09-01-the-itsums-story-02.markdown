 <p>Their story continues&hellip;</p>
</div>

<h1>Progress</h1>
 <p>The Fiat Shack had more and more Itsums in it, so Fiat had to build a House. The Itsums who lived in the House called themselves Chieftains and, of course, King Fiat had a whole wng of it to himself.</p>
 <p>As they became more prosperous they just called themselves <em>Executives</em>.</p>
 <p>Every one of the Itsums who lived the Fiat House literally adored King Fiat, the Supreme Boss.The others were moved to the Shack by then Itsum called Violence.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the Fiat Shack had fallen badly into disrepair, but the Riff-Raff fit in it (tightly), so it was fine.</p>

<h1>The Riff-Raff</h1>
 <p>The Itsums who lived in the Fiat Shack were called the Riff-Raff by the Itsums in the Fiat House. The Riff-Raff had to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities. Itsum Violence made sure they did the work and then back to the shack.</p>
 <p>Itsums in the Fiat Shack had fallen out of grace with Fiat. Some of them had even tried to help other Itsums. Which show how stupid they were  because they obviously did not know that the Riff-Raff could not be helped. Fiat had said so, Fiat had decreed it.</p>
 <p>In any case, the Itsums in the Fiat Shack were the perfect replacements as others disgraced Itsums were falling back to pieces from the hard work.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
 <p>It seemed that Fiat had built the perfect House to attract and entrap Itsums. Even the things that aimed to change the Fiat House became absorved by King Fiat,</p>

 <p>It was obvious that Fiat House was good at corrupting and eating up everything that got in its way.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>But it all change when Radical came together. King Fiat immediately felt the impact.</p>

  </div>
 <p>Radical went over to the Fiat House to talk to them, but Fiat did not want to talk to Radical.</p>
 <p>The other Itsums in the Fiat House just tried to confuse Radical. He found it very strange that Itsums did not want to talk and were more interested in confusing other Itsums.</p>
 <p>Back in the Foundation House, Radical talked to the Itsums and learned that every time they tried to talk they were beaten.</p>

<h1>The Radical Foundation</h1>
  <div>
   <img src="/assets/img/pic-childrens-the-itsums-story-04.svg">
  </div>
 <p>Radical thought and thought and eventually came out with a Foundation. It knew that Itsums had different sensitivies. It also knew that they would not want static dogma like a multipage constitution or a strict structure.</p>
 <p>Radical was aware that the Fiat House might corrupt the Foundation, so Radical made the Radical Foundation very simple and easy to remember.</p>
 <p>The Foundation would help Itsums to stay on the healthier path, and it would encouraged them to compare their ideas with the ideals of the Foundation.</p>

<h1>Nothing New</h1>
 <p>This is not new. In the past other Itsums had identified the many problems that the Fiat House brought, but the proposed solutions were too specific and narrow.</p>

<h1>Radical Foundation</h1>
  <div class="_illustration">Show the Foundation (in yellow?) under a one-story house and the same Foundation over a multi-floor building.</div>
  <div>
   <img src="/assets/img/pic-childrens-the-itsums-story-05.svg">
  </div>
 <p>You can build a one-story house or a 20-story building on the Radical Foundation.</p>
 <p>Anything that goes against the Radical Foundaton, then it is really a Fiat organization in disguise. Fiat organizations are OK, too, <em>if others agree to live in it</em>. We do not want to compete with the many ills brought upon by the Fiat House, we simply want an alternative for living.</p>
