<h1>Fiat had more and more beings in its shack. The shack grew over thousand of years into a big prosperous house. Every one of the beings wo lived there voluntarily loved Fiat or at least pretended to. The ones who were forced to stay there lived in the old, run down shack. But they were the slaves, the riff-raff and none pf te Fiat acolites cared about others, the only cared about themselves.</h1>
