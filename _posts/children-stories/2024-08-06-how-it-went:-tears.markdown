 <p>Their story continues&hellip;</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>Fiat had more and more beings in its shack and, over thousand of years, they had to build a big house. The house became very prosperous.</p>
 <p>Every one of the beings who lived there adored Fiat. The ones who did not adore Fiat had to move to the shack. The shack had fallen into disrepair and was falling-apart.</p>
 <p>The being who lived there were the riff-raff, and none of the Fiat acolites cared about them. Somebody had to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities up and we could not go. They were the stupid beings trying to leave the House without proper authorization or trying to help the beings in the shack and they were the perfect replacements for beings that had the shack beings that fallen back to pieces.</p>
 <p>All beings felt the impact of the Fiat House and they tried, but had bilf the perfect House and everything that went up against it the House would absorb so tht it eventally became part of it.</p>
