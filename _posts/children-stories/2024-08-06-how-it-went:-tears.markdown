 <p>Their story continues&hellip;</p>
</div>

<h1>Progress?</h1>
 <p>Fiat had more and more beings in its shack and, over thousand of years, they had to build a big house. They tried calling themselves chiftains and Kigs, but as the House became more prosperous they just called themselves Fiat.</p>
 <p>Every one of the beings who lived there adored Fiat. The ones who did not adore Fiat had to move to the shack which had fallen badly into disrepair. Actually, ]it was falling-apart.</p>

<h1>The Riff-Raff</h1>
 <p>The beings who lived there were the riff-raff, and none of the Fiat beings cared about them. Somebody had to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities and they could not just go.</p>
 <p>The beings in the shack were stupid, they even tried to help the beings in the shack.</p>
 <p>They were the perfect replacements for the riff-raff that had fallen back to pieces.</p>

<h1>the Impact</h1>
 <p>All beings, in and out of the Fiat House felt the impact of the Fiat House. The had Fiat had built the perfect House.</p>
 <p>Everything that that they tried to change to get rid of its impact eventually became part of it,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Climate change?</li>
   <li>Green washing!</li>
   <li>Discrimination? Bring out the actors who don&rsquo;t have to put the shoe polish on!</li>
   <li>Mysogeny? Point out the she-acolites in Boards!</li>
  <ul>
  <p>The systems that Fiat came up with was good at corrupting and absorbing all that got in its way.</p>
