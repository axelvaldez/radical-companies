 <p>Meaning is the shortest of five children who live in a house called Foundation. He is also the one to stand higher. He is hidden, he is an introvert.</p>
 <p>Belonging is an extrovert. He enjoys others, even when they disagree. Belonging learns a lot from their disagreements.</p>

<h1>Meaning and Belonging</h1>
 <p>Meaning and Belonging always come and go together. They always hold hands, like good friends.</p>
 <p>Meaning lays hidden until it is received by others. It hides atop a mountain and sees all there is. It wants to know where it belongs. That is how it found Belonging</p>
 <br>
 <p>Meaniong becomes taller when it is accepted by others. Meaning becomes stronger when it is supported by others, like Belonging.</p>

 <p>Belonging becomes happier when it finds supporting beings like Meaning.</b>
