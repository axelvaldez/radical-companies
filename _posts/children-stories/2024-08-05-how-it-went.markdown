 <p>How their story continues&hellip;</p>
</div>

<h1>Progress</h1>
  <div class="_illustration">Houses with indications of growig and shrinking</div>
 <p>The Fiat Shack had more and more Itsums in it, so Fiat had to built a full blown House. The Itsums who lived there called themselves Chieftains and Kings, but as the House became more prosperous they just called themselves Executives.</p>
 <p>Every one of the Itsums who lived the Fiat House literally adored Fiat, the Biggest of Bosses. The ones who did not adored the Biggest Boss were moved to the old Shack by Violence.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the Fiat Shack had fallen badly into disrepair.</p>

<h1>The Riff-Raff</h1>
 <p>Actually, the Itsums who lived in the Fiat Shack were the riff-raff.</p>
 <p>Somebody had to work to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities. The Itsum in the Fiat Shack could not just leave and Violence made sure of that.</p>
 <p>Itsums in the Fiat Shack had fallen out of grace with Fiat. Some of them had even tried to help the others Itsums. They were pretty stupid. They obviously did not know that the riff-raff in the Shack could not be helped, as Fiat had decreed.</p>
 <p>That made the Itsums in the Fiat Shack the perfect replacements as others disgraced Itsums who had fallen back to pieces from hard work.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
 <p>All Itsums, in and out of the Fiat House felt the impact of the Fiat House. But, no matter, it seemed that Fiat had built the perfect House to entrap Itsums. Even the things that aimed to change the Fiat House became absorved by it,</p>

 <p>It was obvious that Fiat House was good at absorbing everything that got in its way.</p>
 <br/>
 <p>But the times were changing.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
  <div class="_illustration">You can see some of Radical&rsquo;s face and feet, with pieces from the floor and multicolor hearts levitating.</div>
 <p>Radical came together from pieces on the floor. Like other Itsums, it felt the impact that was coming from the Fiat House.</p>
 <p>He went over there to talk to them. But Fiat did not want to talk to Radical. The others in the Fiat House just tried to confuse Radical. He found that strange that Itsums that did not want to talk and were more interested in confusing other Itsums.</p>
  <div class="_illustration">Itsums from the Fiat House beating Itsums from the Foundation House with wooden sticks&mdash;they look <strong>a lot</strong> like police battons.</div>
 <p>Radical talked to the few Itsums in the Foundation House and learned that every time they tried to talk to the Itsums in the Fiat House they were beaten.</p>

<h1>The Radical Foundation</h1>
  <div class="_illustration">Radical thinking with a dialog balloon with the word "FOUNDATION" in it and the word "DOGMA" crossed out.</div>
 <p>Radical thought and thought and eventually came out with a simple Foundation. It knew that Itsums needed time and they sensitivies. But he also knew that they would want to have something that they could change, not dogma.</p>
 <p>Radical also knew the Fiat House might corrupt the Foundation, so it made the Radical Foundation very simple and easy to remember. The Foundation would encouraged Itsums to ask one another how their ideas compared with the Foundation.</p>

<h1>Nothing New</h1>
 <p>In the past other Itsums had identify the many problems at the Fiat House, but they had not come up with solutions.</p>
  <div class="_illustration">Show the Foundation (in yellow?) under a one-story house and the same Foundation over a multi-floor building.</div>
 <p>You can build a one-story house or a 20-story building on  Radical Foundation, <em>so long as it does not go against its five elements</em>,</p>

 <p>If the proposal goes against the Radical Foundaton, then it is just a Fiat organization. We prefer Foundation Houses, but Fiat organizations are OK, too, <em>if others agree to live in it</em>.</p>
