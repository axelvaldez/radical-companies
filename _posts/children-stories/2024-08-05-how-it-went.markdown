 <p>How their story continues&hellip;</p>
</div>

<h1>Progress</h1>
 <p>The Fiat Shack had more and more Itsums in it, so Fiat had to built a full blown House. The Itsums who lived there calling themselves Chieftains and Kings, but as the House became more prosperous they just called themselves Executives.</p>
 <p>Every one of the Itsums who lived the Fiat House adored Fiat, the Biggest of Bosses. The ones who did not adored the Biggest Boss were moved to the old Shack by Violence.</p>
 <p>The Fiat Shack had, unfortunately, fallen badly into disrepair.</p>

<h1>The Riff-Raff</h1>
 <p>Actually, the Itsums who lived in the Fiat Shack were the riff-raff, and not the Fiat House Itsums.</p>
 <p>Somebody had to work to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities. The Itsum in the Fiat Shack could not just leave and Violence made sure of that.</p>
 <p>Itsums in the Fiat Shack had fallen out of grace with Fiat. Some of them had even tried to help the others Itsums. They obviously did not know that the riff-raff in the Shack could not be helped, as Fiat had decreed.</p>
 <p>That made the Itsums in the Fiat Shack the perfect replacements as others disgraced Itsums had fallen back to pieces from their cruel hard work.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
 <p>All Itsums, in and out of the Fiat House felt the impact of the Fiat House. But, no matter, it seemed that Fiat had built the perfect House to entrap Itsums. Even the things that tried to change the Fiat House became part of it,</p>

 <p>It was obvious that Fiat House was good at absorbing all that got in its way.</p>
 <br/>
 <p>But the times changed.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>Radical came together from pieces on the floor. Like other Itsums, it felt the impact that was coming from the Fiat House.</p>
 <p>He went over there to talk to them. But Biggest Boss Fiat did not want to talk to Radical. The others in the Fiat House just tried to confuse Radical. He found that strange that Itsums that did not want to talk, like Itsums a the foundation House.</p>

<h1>Listen!</h1>
 <p>Radical talked to the few Itsums in the Foundation House and learned that every time they tried to talk to the Itsums in the Fiat House they were beaten.</p>

<h1>The Radical Foundation</h1>
 <p>Radical thought and thought and eventually it came out with a simple Foundation, inspired by the few Itsums left in the Foundation House. It knew that Itsums needed time. It knew that they had different cultures and sensitivies. But he also knew that they would want to have something that they could change, not dogma.</p>
 <p>Radical also knew the Fiat House might corrupt the Foundation. So it made the Radical Foundation very simple and easy to remember. The Foundation would encouraged Itsums to ask one another how their ideas compared with the Foundation. It would even remind them to experiment.</p>'

<h1>Nothing New</h1>
 <p>In the past Itsums had identify many problems tieh the Fiat House, but they had not come with solutions. It seemed that they had forgotten that Itsums learn better from examples.</p>
 <p>You can build a one-story house or a 20-story building on  Radical Foundation, <em>so long as it does not go against its five elements</em>,</p>=

 <p>If the proposal goes against the Radical Foundaton, then it is just a Fiat organization. Fiat organizations are OK, too, <em>if the co-owners agree to it</em>.</p>
