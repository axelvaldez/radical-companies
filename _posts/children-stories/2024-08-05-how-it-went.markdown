 <p>Their story continues&hellip;</p>
</div>

<h1>Progress?</h1>
 <p>The Fiat Shack had more and more Itsums in it, so had to built a full blown House. The Itsums who lived there calling themselves Chieftains and Kings, but as the House became more prosperous they just called themselves Executives.</p>
 <p>Every one of the Itsums who lived the Fiat House adored Fiat, the Biggest of Bosses. The ones who did not adored the Biggest Boss were moved to the old Shack by Violence.</p>
 <p>The Shack had, unfortunately, fallen badly into disrepair.</p>

<h1>The Riff-Raff</h1>
 <p>Actually, the Itsums who lived in the shack were the riff-raff, and none of the Fiat House Itsums. Somebody had to work to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities. They could no just go and Violence made sure of that.</p>
 <p>Some Itsums in the shack even tried to help other Itsums. They obbviously did not know that the riff-raff in the Shack could not be helped, as Fiat had explained.</p>
 <p>The Itsums who had fallen out of grace were the perfect replacements for the riff-raff that had let themselves fallen back to pieces from overwork.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
 <p>All Itsums, in and out of the Fiat House felt the impact of the Fiat House. But, no matter, it seemed that Fiat had built the perfect House to entrap Itsums. Even the things that tried to change the Fiat House became part of it,</p>

 <p>It was obvious that Fiat House was good at absorbing all that got in its way.</p>
 <br/>
 <p>But the times changed.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>Radical came together from pieces on the floor. Like othres Itsum, it felt the impact right away that was coming from the Fiat House.</p>
 <p>He went over there to talk to them. But Biggest Boss Fiat did not want to talk to Radical. The others just tried to confuse Fiat. He found that strange that Itsums that did not want to talk.</p>
 <p>What the&hellip;?</p>

<h1>Listen!</h1>
 <p>Radical talked to the Itsums in the Foundation House and learned that every time they tried to talk to the Itsums in the Fiat House they were beaten.</p>

<h1>The Radical Foundation</h1>
 <p>Radical thought and thought. Eventually it came out with a simple Foundation. He knew that people needed time, he knew that they had different cultures and sensitivies. But he also knew that they would want to have something that they could change, not dogma.</p>
 <p>Radical also knew the danger of Fiat absorbing the Foundation. So the Foundation had to be simple and easy to remember. Itsums could ask one another how ideas compared with the Foundation. And theyn were reminded to experiment.</p>'

<h1>Nothing New</h1>
 <p>Over time Itsums had identify the problems, but they had not come sith sample solutions. It seemed that they had forgotten that Itsums learn better from examples. You can build a one-story house or a 20-story building on it, <em>so long as it does not go against the five Radical Foundation</em>,</p>=

 <p>If the proposal goes against the Radical Foundaton, then it is just a Fiat organization. And Fiat organizations are OK, too, <em>if the co-owners agree to it</em>.</p>
