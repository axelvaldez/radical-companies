 <p>Their story continues&hellip;</p>
</div>

<h1>Progress?</h1>
 <p>The Fiat House had more and more Itsums in its shack and over many years they had to build a much bigger House. The Itsums who lived there calling themselves Chieftains and then Kings, but as the House became more prosperous they just called themselves Executives.</p>
 <p>Every one of the Itsums who lived the House adored Fiat, the Biggest of Bosses. The ones who did not adored the Biggest Boss had to move to the Shack. Unfortunately, the Shack had fallen badly into disrepair.</p>

<h1>The Riff-Raff</h1>
 <p>Actually, the Itsums who lived in the shack were the riff-raff, and none of the Fiat House Itsums cared about them. Somebody had to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities. They could no just go.</p>
 <p>The Itsums in the shack were so stupid that they even tried to help other Itsums. They obbvoiusly did not know that the riff-raff in the shack were stupid and could not be helped.</p>
 <p>The Itsums who had fallen out of grace were the perfect replacements for the riff-raff that had fallen back to pieces from overwork.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
 <p>All Itsums, in and out of the Fiat House felt the impact of the Fiat House. But, no matter, it seemed that Fiat had built the perfect House to entrap Itsums. Even the things that tried to change the Fiat House became part of it,</p>

 <p>It was obvious that Fiat House was good at absorbing all that got in its way.</p>
 <br/>
 <p>But the times changed.</p>

<h1>Things Changed</h1>
 <p>Radical came together from pieces on the floor left by others as they came apart. It felt the impact right away and it knew that it was coming from the Fiat House.</p>
 <p>He went over there to talk to them. But Fiat did not want to talk to Radical and the othersles and tried to confuse Fiat. He found that strange that Itsums that did not want to talk.</p>
 <p>What the&hellip;?</p>

<h1>Listen!</h1>
 <p>Radical talked to the Itsums in the Foundation House and learned that every time they tried to talk to the Itsums in the Fiat House (surprise!) they were beaten back with long sticks.</p>

<h1>The Radical Foundation</h1>
 <p>Radical finally came out with a simple Foundation. He knew that people needed time, he knew that they had different cultures and sensitivies. But he also knew that they would want to have something that they could change, not dogma.</p>
 <p>Radical also knew the danger of Fiat absorbing the Foundation. So the Foundation had to be simple and easy to remember. It was important that Itsums could ask one another how ideas compared with the Foundation tenets. It was important that they were reminded to experiment.</p>
 <p>A lot of Itsums could identify the problems, but they had forgotten specific solutions. They had forgotten that Itsums learn better from examples.</p>
 <p>And so the Radical Foundation came together. You can build a one-story house or a 20-story building on it, <em>so long as it does not go against the five Foundation tenets</em>,</p>

 <p>If the proposal goes against the Radical Foundaton, then it is just a Fiat organization. But that is OK, too, <em>if the co-owners agree to it</em>.</p>
