 <p>How their story continues&hellip;</p>
</div>

<h1>Progress</h1>
 <p>The Fiat Shack had more and more Itsums in it, so Fiat had to built a full blown House. The Itsums who lived there called themselves Chieftains and Kings, but as the House became more prosperous they just called themselves Executives.</p>
 <p>Every one of the Itsums who lived the Fiat House literally adored Fiat, the Supreme Boss. The ones who did not adored the Supreme Boss eventually were moved to the old Shack by Violence.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the Fiat Shack had fallen badly into disrepair.</p>

<h1>The Riff-Raff</h1>
 <p>The Itsums who lived in the Fiat Shack were called the riff-raff by the Itsums in the Fiat House.</p>
  <div class="_illustration">The Fiat Shack indisrepair and Itsums inside like slaves.</div>
 <p>The riff-raff had to work to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities. Violence made sure that they could not leave.</p>
 <p>Itsums in the Fiat Shack had fallen out of grace with Fiat. Some of them had even tried to help the others Itsums. They were pretty stupid because they obviously did not know that the riff-raff in the Shack could not be helped. Fiat had said so, IT had decreed it.</p>
 <p>That made the Itsums in the Fiat Shack the perfect replacements as others disgraced Itsums were fallen back to pieces from hard work.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
 <p>All Itsums, in and out of the Fiat House felt the impact of the Fiat House. But, no matter, it seemed that Fiat had built the perfect House to entrap Itsums and their complaints. Even the things that aimed to change the Fiat House became absorved by it,</p>

 <p>It was obvious that Fiat House was good at absorbing and corrupting everything that got in its way.</p>
 <br/>
 <p>But the times were changing.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
  <div class="_illustration">You can see some of Radical&rsquo;s face and feet, with pieces from the floor and multicolor hearts levitating.</div>
 <p>Radical came together from pieces on the floor. Like other Itsums, it immediately felt the impact that was coming from the Fiat House.</p>
 <p>He went over there to talk to them. But Fiat did not want to talk to Radical. The others in the Fiat House just tried to confuse Radical. He found that strange that Itsums that did not want to talk and were more interested in confusing other Itsums.</p>
  <div class="_illustration">Itsums from the Fiat House beating Itsums from the Foundation House with wooden sticks&mdash; that look <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> like police battons.</div>
 <p>Back in the Foundation House Radical talked to a couple of Itsums and learned that every time they tried to talk to the Itsums in the Fiat House they were beaten with sticks.</p>

<h1>The Radical Foundation</h1>
  <div class="_illustration">Radical thinking with a dialog balloon with the word "FOUNDATION" in it and the word "DOGMA" crossed out.</div>
 <p>Radical thought and thought and eventually came out with a simple Foundation. It knew that Itsums needed time and they had different sensitivies. It also knew that they would want to have something that they could change, not static dogma.</p>
 <p>Radical also knew the Fiat House might corrupt the Foundation, so it made the Radical Foundation very simple and easy to remember. The Foundation would as mch as possible keep Itsums on the path; it encouraged Itsums to ask questions of one another. It would encouraged them to compare their ideas with the Foundation basics.</p>

<h1>Nothing New</h1>
 <p>In the past other Itsums had identify the many problems at the Fiat House, like Climate Change, but the solutions were too narrow.</p>
  <div class="_illustration">Show the Foundation (in yellow?) under a one-story house and the same Foundation over a multi-floor building.</div>
 <p>You can build a one-story house or a 20-story building on  Radical Foundation, <em>so long as it does not go against its five foundational blocks</em>,</p>

  </div>
 <p>If the proposal goes against the Radical Foundaton, then it is really a Fiat organization. Fiat organizations are OK, too, <em>if others agree to live in it</em>. We do not want to compete with the many ills of the Fiat House, we want to create an alternative for living.</p>
