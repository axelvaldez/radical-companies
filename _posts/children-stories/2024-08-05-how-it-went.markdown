 <p>Their story continues&hellip;</p>
</div>

<h1>Progress?</h1>
 <p>The Fiat House had more and more Itsum in its shack and over many years they had to build a much bigger House. The Itsums who lived tried calling themselves Chieftains, Kings, but as the House became more prosperous they just called themselves Executives.</p>
 <p>Every one of the Itsums who lived the House adored Fiat, the Biggest of Bosses. The ones who did not adored the Biggest Boss had to move to the Shack. Unfortunately, the Shack had fallen badly into disrepair.</p>

<h1>The Riff-Raff</h1>
 <p>Actually, the Itsums who lived in the shack were the riff-raff, and none of the Fiat House Itsums cared about them. Somebody had to keep up the Fiat House and its amenities. They could no just go.</p>
 <p>The Itsums in the shack were so stupid that they even tried to help Itsums. They obbvoiusly did not know what everybody knows, the riff-raff in the shack were stupid and could not be helped.</p>
 <p>The Itsums who had fallen out of grace were the perfect replacements for the riff-raff that had fallen back to pieces.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
 <p>All Itsums, in and out of the Fiat House felt the impact of the Fiat House. but,  no matter, Fiat had built the perfect House.</p>
 <p>Everything that that they tried to change eventually became part of it,</p>

 <p>It wa obvious that Fiat House was good at absorbing all that got in its way.</p>
 <p>An eagle flew and the times changed.</p>

<h1>Things Changed</h1>
 <p>Radical came together from pieces on the floor left by others as they came apart. It felt the impact right away and it knew that it was coming from the Fiat House, so he went over there to talk to them. But Fiat did not want to talk to Radical and the othersles and tried to confuse Fiat.</p>
 <p>He found that strange, Itsums that did not want to talk.</p> spoke in circ
 <p>What the&hellip;?</p>

<h1>Listen!</h1>
 <p>Radical talked to the Itsums in the Foundation House and learned that every time they tried to talk to the Itsums in the Fiat House (surprised) they were beaten back with long sticks.</p>

<h1>The Radical Foundation</h1>
 <p>Radical thought and thought and finally came out with a simple Foundation. He knew that people needed time, he knew that they had different cultures. He knew that they would want to have something that they could change, not dogma.</p>
 <p>But Radical also knew the danger of Fiat absorbing the Foundation. So the Foundation had to be simple and easy to remember. It was important that Itsums could ask one another how their proposal compared with the Foundation.</p>
 <p>A lot of Itsums could identify the problems, but they had forgotten specific solutions. They had forgotten that Itsums learn better from examples.</p>
 <p>And so the Radical Foundation came together. You can build a one-story house or a 20-story building on it, <em>so long as it does not go against the five Foundation tenets</em>,</p>

 <p>If the proposal goes against the fundamemtal tenets of the Radical Foundaton, then it is a Fiat organization. And that is OK, too, if the co-owners agree to it. Eventually they may walk away from it or the community will change or not.</p>
