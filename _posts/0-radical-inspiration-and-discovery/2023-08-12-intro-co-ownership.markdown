 <p>Introduction to co-ownership.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>As opposed to centralized <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> ownership, which is what we live with now, co-ownership is profoundly transformative. It evokes hope and possibility. This revolutionary concept marks the demise of oligarchic wealth and decentralized power. Gone are the days of toiling for a mere wage; instead, you will be rewarded based on the contributions you make as recognized by your peer. No longer will a traditional  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> owner hoard the wealth generated by your efforts. Instead, you will reap the wealth you helped create, enjoying an empowering and fulfilling experience.</p>
 <p>Co-ownership is the least understood thing about the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> paradigm. It is not a co-op and it is not revenue sharing. It is powerfully different. We&rsquo;ll get into the details of it below.</p>

<h1>RADs Instead of Shares</h1>
 <p>Before I go on, I need to explain what <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are.</p>
 <p>The name, RADs, is meaningless. It is the first name I could think of. But they are the key to decentralized ownership.</p>
 <p>We are used to ”somebody else,” the boss, owning the business. <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s make it possible to have decentralized ownership, where you and your peers own the company. You are part of creating value and wealth, and with <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you are a co-owner of it.</p>
 <p>The value that you help create shows up as revenue, money paid for your goods or services. With decentralized ownership, you are a co-owner of that revenue. Now &ldquo;somebody else&rdquo; owns it.</p>

<h1>Not Revenue Sharing</h1>
 <p>Revenue sharing is done according to what the boss says people are going to get. In the  <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based model, the system is decentralized and there is no boss to decide what you are going to get. Instead, your peers decide how many <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you get and you decide how many they get.</p>
 <p>The percentage of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you end up with determines what percentage of the revenue you get.</p>

<h1>Not a Co-op</h1>
 <p>Co-operatives make everybody financially equal. But people&rsquo;s contributions are not equal. The same person can contribute a lot one month, but less the next.</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are used to keep a tally of contributions.</p>

<h1>How RADs Work</h1>
 <p>Now we can talk about how RADs work.</p>
 <p>The whole thing starts with recognized contributions. As you do your work, other co-owners will recognize some of it as contributions that resonate with them and they will record those using the <em>RADs! mobile app</em> by simply pressing a button. The more significant you find the contribution, the more button presses.</p>
 <p>At the end of the cycle (<em>e.g.</em>, a week, a month), the app calculates how many <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s those recognized contributions translate to. That many RADs are given to each of the contributing co-owners.</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s accumulate, so each cycle adds to existing RADs.</p>

<h1>Shares Tired, RADs Wired</h1>
 <p>As I mentioned,  <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based companies don&rsquo;t have shares. Ownership is based on recognized contributions, not capital</p>
 <p>Shares are a 16<sup>th</sup> century invention that worked pretty much as <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s, with one significant difference: shares are based on capital while RA<span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>sDs are based on recognized contributions. But they are both ways to create something bigger than one person could.</p>
 <p>Business shares must have sounded crazy, like <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s sound today. The clientele for shares back then already were risk takers and it was a smaller audience. The audience for RADs is everybody who has been trained since birth to work for a wage and leave everything else to the oligarchic owners. We are counting on them being more educated and who sense that the current system is not working for them.</p>

<h1>Decentralized Ownership</h1>
 <p>Decentralized ownership is sustainable. The company is not dependent on a top boss. It is forever flexible.</p>
 <p>Decentralized ownership lasts&hellip; forever. For one, there is no issue of inheritance.</p>

<h1>Co-ownership is dynamic</h1>
 <p>Say in January you make a lot of contributions that are recognized by your peers. Your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s go up quite a bit. But in February you are down to routine things. You get a few recognized contributions, but not many. Your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s go up a bit, but not much.</p>
 <p>In March you and your team give talks about the projects you just finished and how it is going to reduce costs significantly. Your recognized contributions go up and so do your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s. Then you go on vacation in April. Your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s stay the same but the total <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s go up (<em>e.g.</em>, more people) so your percentage of revenue goes down.</p>
 <p>Your level of revenue ownership bobs up and down depending on 1) the contributions you make, and 2) how many of those are recognized by your peers.</p>
 <p>The same is going on for every co-owner and their level of revenue ownership changes.</p>

<h1>No Get-Rich-Quick Scheme</h1>
 <p>In our  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world, owning a business is the way to accumulate a lot of money. You pay yourself well and keep the dividends. If you are lucky, somebody buys your company and you make a big lump sum. In the  <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based approach, this is not it.</p>
 <p>You accumulate  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> money by keeping the wealth that other people created. Yes, you pay them good wages to do so, but you keep the bulk of the value they create. In the  <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based space you get paid according to the contributions that your peer co-owners recognize. Because you are getting a portion of what a  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> owner keeps, you have the potential of making much more than a mere wage.</p>

<h1>Capital</h1>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>But, I need capital. That is the normal way to get started!</span></p>
 <p>Capital still has a role to play, but it just doesn&rsquo;t get power over the company.</p>

 <p>A  <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> Investment is more like a loan, but with negotiated returns. More below.</p>
 <p>The point being that mere capital doesn’t get of the powers that investors get in the  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world.</p>

<h1>What’s the Catch?</h1>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>Sounds like people are not guaranteed a salary!</span></p>
 <p>And, yes, people are not guaranteed a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> salary. However, if you choose, the <span class='_paradigm'>PRI Fund</span> can provide a <em>Predictable, Recurring Income.</em></p>
 <p>If &ldquo;more&rdquo; means more than just being a replaceable resource in the money-making machine, then, yes, you are expected to do more,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You are expected to speak up if you think another co-owner is trying to game the system.</li>
   <li>You are expected to care.</li>
   <li>You are expected to talk to your peer co-owners so they understand what you are working on and how it will benefit them and the community.</li>
   <li>You are expected to speak up when you see opportunities that others may not see.</li>
   <li>You can help people to migrate out of violent language and into language that helps to learn and grow.</li>
   <li>To do all that and more because it is <em>your</em> company.</li>
  </ul>
 <p style='font-size:larger; '>That is the catch!</p>
