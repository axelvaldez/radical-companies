 <p>Intro to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat System</span> and to the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical Foundation.</span>.</p>
</div>

<h1>Rules, Laws, and Force</h1>
 <p>Imagine a world where rules, initially upheld through conventions, eventually morph into cold, heartless <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> laws that leave us no choice but to comply. <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is a relentless force, bearing down on us with an iron grip.</p>
 <p>Picture this,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You get a traffic ticket. A very minor form of force.</li>
   <li>You have to give up money (<em>i.e.</em>, coined force) to be spared the pain that would follow if you don&rsquo;t.</li>
   <li>If you strongly feel that is an injustice, you let it go to court (<em>i.e.</em>, another type of force).</li>
   <li>Either you win or you lose,
    <ul>
     <li>Victory brings celebration, the force is with you.</li>
     <li>If you are defeated, you are angry, but you have to pay the ticket. Still a minor force.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>On the other hand, if you happen to be from the edge, any sort of protest or disobedience may send you to prison. This is no longer a minor force.</li>
   <li>Behind those cold, unforgiving walls a fight may break out and blood is spilled and lives are maimed or lost. Either way, it is definitely a <em>force majeure.</em></li>
  </ul>
 <p>Force is ever present in our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. It goes from merely a frown to the ghastly specter of the electric chair.</p>
 <p>Withholding a reward because you did not say or did what was expected of you is a form of force. Getting passed over for a raise or promotion is a form of force. Firing you or laying you off is a form of force. Raising your rent so your only option is to leave is a form of force. We are surrounded by a system that runs on force, from threats to actual pain.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Motivation&rdquo; is another form of force. Do this and you&rsquo;ll get the reward. We often fail to see it for what it truly isâ€”an external force, driving us toward someone else's desires. But you are being &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; to do what somebody else wants, regardless of what you may want to do. That is force.</p>
 <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>-base alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system there is no do-it-or-else force. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> myth is that without force we would never do anything of significance, we would never do anything bigger than ourselves. They try to shatter our belief in our own capabilities, in our power of our collective potential.</p>
 <p>But I ask you to consider this: humanity evolved and has survived and thrived as a species for a long time. We birthed agriculture, spreading its roots across every corner of the planet. We managed to do all that and more without anybody dictating our path, without anyone wielding force to mold us.</p>
 <p>Then came the people who took things by force, because they had nothing to trade. And then came money, coinage which allowed them to trade the wealth that they extracted from you by force. And slowly by surely the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system took shape around us.</p>
 <p>Alongside, there came the stories that supported the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system as it evolved,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>An all powerful supernatural being at the top</li>
   <li>Paradise</li>
   <li>Eve as the bad apple</li>
   <li>Homosexuality and shellfish as abominations, pushed to the edge.</li>
   <li><span class='_quotespan'>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ,</span> from the Judeo-Christian Old Testament</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Most Insidious</h1>
 <p>Most insidious of all, we learn to expect that the fruit of our work should go to someone else,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A god, an omnipotent being at the top</li>
   <li>A boss, an omnipotent being at the top.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>And that we get paid what the boss says is reasonable.</p>
 <p>It didn&rsquo;t start this way, but it evolved. First came prisoners of minor wars that were made to carry whatever the winners didn&rsquo;t want to carry, including the winners dead. At the end they either joined the winners (after all, they were related) or they went back to their village. Then came slavery, they kept you as a worthless worker because they had the force (and you were not related). Finally came wage work. From forced labor by sheer force to forced labor by coin. Different forms of force, but force throughout.</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> tendrils extend deep into every aspect of our lives, particularly in the realms of economics and politics. For example, &ldquo;being a good worker&rdquo; is a sign of pride today within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system you and I live in. Unwavering loyalty to their chosen politicians, no matter the cost. There is nothing strange about it, it is totally normal. The alternative, they say, is chaos to be avoided at all costs.</p>
 <p>Anybody talking about alternatives (you and I) must be crazy. Ignore them.</p>
 <p>Organized religion has been part of the support system as well, but before we talk about that, we have to talk about divide-and-conquer.</p>
