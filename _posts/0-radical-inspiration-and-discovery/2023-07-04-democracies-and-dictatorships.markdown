 <p>Intro to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat System</span> and to the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical Foundation.</span>.</p>
</div>

<h1>Democracies to Dictatorships</h1>
 <p>The Fiat model and its embedded force is at the root of all governance, from democracies to dictatorships. Can you think of a decentralized national government? I can&rsquo;t, either, because it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

     <th>Fiat</th>
     <td>
      <p>I have already said a lot about Fiat. One thing I mentioned in passing is that Fiat evolved into the complex mess it is today. For example, the Christian Bible admonished slaves to &ldquo;obey your earthly masters.&rdquo; However, when outright slavery went out the door, that stopped being acceptable language (though the majority of women and children to this day still have to obey their earthly masters).</p>
      <p>The thing that has remained constant in the Fiat system is Force.</p>

      <p>As opposed to Fiat, Radical is a Foundation of what we need at the root of the system (<em>i.e.</em>, in yellow, below), not a system that has evolved to be a big, hairy ball of hair. Radical does not have embedded rules and it is not dogmatic in any way,</p>

      <p> When looking for solutions to what we feel is wrong, we often get lost in the intellectual weeds and point to the first obvious thing. We never get beyond this point and we end up never discovering what&rsquo;s really at the root of the problem. The Radical Foundation helps us remain clear,</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Will this decision make us more or less decentralized? Either choice is up to you and your community, but the Foundation helps you know which direction the decision is  taking you.</li>
        <li>Will this decision make it easier to help people find meaning in what they are doing or not? Again, either choice is up to you and your community, but the Foundation helps you know where you are headed.</li>
        <p>You may be leaning one way, but rethink it once you realize where it would take you. What you definitely will not be able to do is hide behind, &ldquo;<em>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know!</em>&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Radical doesn&rsquo;t come with rules out of the box, but you and the community of people you work with can come up with any rules you want; without Force. You are all co-owners  and none of you have the right to Force to others.</p>
