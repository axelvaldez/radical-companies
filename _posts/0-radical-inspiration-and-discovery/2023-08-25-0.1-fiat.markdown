<h1>What the Fiat System Does</h1>


<p>
If you are feeling overwhelmed by work, it is not a matter of working harder. That is what your boss tells you, and even your well-meaning co-workers. That is what every business book says, to search for excellence, acquire new habits to move up, and do more with less effort. But it is not you, it is the system that we call Fiat. The Fiat system is designed to create more wealth for the owners and investors of the business you work for.
</p>
<p>
The thing is that we created it, and we can create an alternative system, an alternative way of living.
</p>
<p>
“Fixing” the Fiat system would be never-ending because the system is too easy to game, particularly by powerful people. The Fiat system adapts to fixes very fast.
</p>
<p>
Beware that alternatives to Fiat are fundamentally different and will feel alien, idealistic, and even crazy. It will take more courage than you can imagine.
</p>

If you are not open to this and are just being polite (“<em>Sounds interesting… tell me more about it</em>”), you can return the book now. Sorry for any inconvenience.

<h1>What Does Fiat Even Mean?</h1>


<p>
You may not even know what the heck Fiat means, but there is something, a feeling you have, that tells you that something is not quite right. And, you are correct in that it is not right, at all. Perhaps you are spending too much time at work. Or you are always ready to travel to a last-minute destination. Or maybe you have to do what would be three days’ worth of work in two, or one, hoping for an attaboy and maybe a reward. Don't worry, you will get a chance to rest when you get back, but the pile of work is bigger when you get back.
</p>
<p>
Maybe you are fully aware of this or maybe you think that this is our destiny. But it is not “our destiny,” it is not living. It is the Fiat system that we live in.
</p>
<p>
We want to help you see Fiat and how it is causing you the way you feel.
</p>
<h1>Fiat, the Word</h1>


<p>
“<em>But Fiat it’s a car.</em>” And, indeed, FIAT as an acronym is the name of an Italian automobile car manufacturer that stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino</em>. Thus the acronym.
</p>
<p>
But what does <em>the word</em> Fiat mean?
</p>
<p>
Fiat is an honest-to-goodness word that means because I say so. Fiat money, for example, is worth what each nation says it is (plus or minus what investors will pay for it). Money used to be an equivalent to gold, but that stopped in the 1970s. Now it is because the country says so (and nominally its economy)..
</p>
<p>
In the context of giving orders, the phrase additionally carries an implied threat: or else. "<em>Move those boxes from there to over there…  because I say so… or else).</em>”
</p>
<h1>The Fiat System</h1>


<p>
We live in a Fiat environment, or more accurately, a Fiat system. Some people do not like the word system associated with their lives, and that is understandable. “<em>My life is not limited by any system, I shape it however I want to</em>.” Maybe “ecology” is more your thing, but an ecology is a system, too.
</p>
<p>
We created the Fiat system and we uphold it. You have a boss, within the Fiat system. And within the Fiat system, you work for a wage, but the wealth that you help create goes to the owner of the business you work for, not yourself. These are elements of the Fiat system that we created, we live in, and we uphold.
</p>
<p>
Worse, the Fiat system is based on,
</p>
<ul>

<li>Competition, not collaboration.

<li>Dividing people, not bringing us together

<li>Threats, fear, force, and pain. Not wellbeing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Luckily, there are <em>alternatives</em> to the Fiat system.
</p>
<h1>It Starts with Rules</h1>


<p>
As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don’t fit in society, you are going to be pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the “edge” included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Anybody with an addiction or a tick were at the edge as well.
</p>
<p>
Then, if we are lucky, we go to a pre-school. We have to unlearn some rules (did you hit him back harder?) and learn new ones (keep your hands to yourself).
</p>
<p>
Lucky that we are, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. “<em>That will be on the test!</em>”
</p>
<p>
Also, in primary school is when we start to put on the Fiat glasses.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
If we happen to live in an “advanced” country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simply fiddling with them and learning to make them more comfortable. No matter, we make sure that the Fiat lenses are never, ever off. We want to stay away from the people who don't know how to wear their glasses correctly.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we go to work, with our Fiat glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and how to be a good worker. We are happy to be a resource and happier that we are getting a steady wage (until—surprise—we are not).
</p>
<p>
We learn to be kind and condescending to the ones whose glasses are skewed and not fitting correctly. We do our best for these people, but they just don’t want to learn the rules. They want to live on the edge.
</p>
<h1>The Fiat System Is…</h1>


<p>
That is what Fiat system is,
</p>
<ul>

<li>Learning the rules,

<li>Following the rules,

<li>Enforcing the rules.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Think of what happens when you get caught not following the rules. Think of how many decisions you have made, now think of how you considered in the back of your head what your boss would think of them. Think of how many times you have said, I am pretty sure that Bob is not going to like it! You can’t make a decision without considering Bob, your boss.
</p>
<p>
You may be thinking, “<em>How else would the system work? Things would not work without Bob.</em>” That’s part of what we learn as we grow up in the Fiat system. It is Bob or chaos. You do what you do because of Bob, your boss. And it is absolutely bad logic encouraged by the Fiat system.
</p>
<h1>Rules, Laws, and Force</h1>


<p>
Imagine a world where rules, initially upheld through conventions, eventually morph into cold, heartless Fiat laws that leave us no choice but to comply. Fiat is a relentless force, bearing down on us with an iron grip.
</p>
<p>
Picture this,
</p>
<ul>

<li>You get a traffic ticket. A very minor form of force.

<li>You have to give up money (<em>i.e.</em>, coined force) to be spared the pain that would follow if you don’t.

<li>If you strongly feel that is an injustice, you let it go to court (<em>i.e.</em>, another type of force).

<li>Either you win or you lose, 
<ul>
 
<li>Victory brings celebration, the force is with you.
 
<li>If you are defeated, you are angry, but you have to pay the ticket. Still a minor force.
</li> 
</ul>

<li>On the other hand, if you happen to be from the edge, any sort of protest or disobedience may send you to prison. This is no longer a minor force.

<li>Behind those cold, unforgiving walls a fight may break out and blood is spilled and lives are maimed or lost. Either way, it is definitely a force majeure.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Force is ever present in our Fiat system. It goes from merely a frown to the ghastly specter of the electric chair.
</p>
<p>
Withholding a reward because you did not say or did what was expected of you is a form of force. Getting passed over for a raise or promotion is a form of force. Firing you or laying you off is a form of force. Raising your rent so your only option is to leave is a form of force. We are surrounded by a system that runs on force, from threats to actual pain.
</p>
<p>
Motivation is another form of force. Do this and you’ll get the reward. We often fail to see it for what it truly is—an external force, driving us toward someone else's desires. But you are being “motivated” to do what somebody else wants, regardless of what you may want to do. That is force.
</p>
<p>
In the Fiat-base alternative to the Fiat system there is no do-it-or-else force. The Fiat myth is that without force we would never do anything of significance, we would never do anything bigger than ourselves. They try to shatter our belief in our own capabilities, in our power of our collective potential.
</p>
<p>
But I ask you to consider this: humanity evolved and has survived and thrived as a species for a long time. We birthed agriculture, spreading its roots across every corner of the planet. We managed to do all that and more without anybody dictating our path, without anyone wielding force to mold us.
</p>
<p>
Then came the people who took things by force, because they had nothing to trade. And then came money, coinage which allowed them to trade the wealth that they extracted from you by force. And slowly by surely the Fiat system took shape around us.
</p>
<p>
Alongside, there came the stories that supported the Fiat system as it evolved,
</p>
<ul>

<li>An all powerful supernatural being at the top

<li>Paradise

<li>Eve as the bad apple

<li>Homosexuality and shellfish as abominations, pushed to the edge.

<li>“<em>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.</em>”<a href="#bookmark=id.ysooerb3kmpx">∇</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most insidious of all, we learn to expect that the fruit of our work should go to someone else,
</p>
<ul>

<li>A god, an omnipotent being at the top

<li>A boss, an omnipotent being at the top.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And that we get paid what the boss says is reasonable.
</p>
<p>
It didn’t start this way, but it evolved. First came prisoners of minor wars that were made to carry whatever the winners didn’t want to carry, including the winners dead. At the end they either joined the winners (after all, they were related) or they went back to their village. Then came slavery, they kept you as a worthless worker because they had the force (and you were not related). Finally came wage work. From forced labor by sheer force to forced labor by coin. Different forms of force, but force throughout.
</p>
<p>
Fiat tendrils extend deep into every aspect of our lives, particularly in the realms of economics and politics. For example, “being a good worker” is a sign of pride today within the Fiat system you and I live in. Unwavering loyalty to their chosen politicians, no matter the cost. There is nothing strange about it, it is totally normal. The alternative, they say, is chaos to be avoided at all costs.
</p>
<p>
Anybody talking about alternatives (you and I) must be crazy. Ignore them.
</p>
<p>
Organized religion has been part of the support system as well, but before we talk about that, we have to talk about divide-and-conquer.
</p>
<h1>Countries and Other Divisions</h1>


<h2>Fiat</h2>


<p>
Countries are Fiat creations, straight out of kingdoms that had been cleansed by force.
</p>
<p>
For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to conquer the Americas, they waged their own cleansing campaign on their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act as Catholics and speak Castilian (or else). The Inquisition stood as a merciless enforcer, ensuring obedience to the Church.
</p>
<p>
By the time they got to the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla had developed a methodology to cleanse whatever other cultures they encountered—a tool to subjugate, control, and obliterate anything that stood in their way,

   <td>At some point women were made the property of men and were made subservient to them. That is, for example, why inherited last names are the man’s. The <em>ez</em> at the end of Spanish family names is the equivalent to the possessive English (<em>i.e.</em>, Pedro’s) to indicate that it “belongs to” to the men. Men were the kings of their castle and women were reduced to chattel. Sounds comical, but there is an intuitive logic to it: men now had to worry about staying in control of what belonged to them, and not about the injustices from the powerful men above.
</p>
<p>
It all was bundled with a strong ideology that created an institution and, surprisingly enough, women became pillars of it. Eve was the instigator of sin, and must submit for salvation. Women covered their hair, wore burkas, and relinquished their autonomy in the name of duty and survival.
</p>



<pre class="prettyprint">The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don't turn against him, they crush those beneath them.

<p>
As Christianity spread by force of colonization, non-Europeans were made subservient to Europeans. Of course, there were wealthy non-Europeans, close to their colonial masters, and poor non-Europeans. The wealthier were even put in charge.
</p>
<p>
We are still struggling with that attitude today, thousands of years later. We could be in paradise, but the woman enticed us to bite the apple of knowledge and poisoned us. We are still struggling with the leftovers of colonization, domestic and foreign. We are on our way to bring it all out in the open and heal the wounds, but it is a struggle as powerful people cling to the past.
