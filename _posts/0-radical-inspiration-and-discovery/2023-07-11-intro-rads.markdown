 <p>Intro to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat System</span> and to the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical Foundation.</span>.</p>
</div>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>In a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> business, things are static. &ldquo;<em>You give me so much cash, and I&rsquo;ll give you a percentage of the company</em>.&rdquo; That percentage of the business  remains fixed forever. You can even die and your heirs inherit that piece of the business. They will try to dilute you, but if you stay on your tippy toes, you can fight it.</p>
 
<h1>>Radical</span></h1>
 <p>In a company based on <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>, things are dynamic. You give me so much cash, negotiate a return, and you get your principal and the negotiated return in a negotiated timeframe. You contribute a lot this month and you end up with a serious percentage of all RADs and you get a serious percentage of the dividends. Next month you don&rsquo;t contribute as much and you end up with a smaller percentage of RADs and a smaller percentage of dividends. Ownership is dynamic.</p>

<h1>What Are RADs?</h1>
 <p>RADs are like tokensâ€”not crypto tokens or anything like them. Your RADs really are a percentage of all RADs ever given. That is your percentage of whatever is distributed through them. Most often it is dividends. That is what remains of the revenue after paying all expenses, taxes, and any investments. This usually goes to the owners, but in <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> companies it goes to people who create the wealth, people like you, the co-owners.</p>
 <p>The number of RADs you get for a given cycle (<em>e.g.</em>, one month) is calculated from the number of Recognized Contributions. These are your contributions that your peer co-owners have recognized as significant. They accumulate and at the end of the month the <em>RADs! Mobile App</em> calculates the number of RADs that each co-owner gets. They may be guidelines that your community has agreed to, but in the end it is whatever moves you to press the recognition button.</p>

 <p>The reason I think that the RADs! Mobile App is fundamental is because it is likely the sharp end of the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> spear,</p>

<h1>People Need to Learn How to Be Owners</h1>
 <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world we live in, we are trained to look for a job. Preferably, a high status, high paying job. When we talk about being an owner&hellip; well, we don&rsquo;t talk about that. &ldquo;<em>Some people do that, but it is a lot of work and why would you want to work that hard for a bare living?</em>&rdquo; And if the business fails to make you &ldquo;<em>a bare living</em>,&rdquo; that mark&rsquo;s on you forever. &ldquo;<em>Get a good job instead. I hear the Post Office is hiring!</em>&rdquo;</p>
 <p>People need to learn to be owners and all the fear that it brings up. They have to learn to recognize others&rsquo; contributions without being afraid of &ldquo;making them look good.&rdquo; People need to learn to collaborate, and get away from competing all the time. They have to be able to let others know what they are doing and why you think it is important to all co-owners, it ain&rsquo;t bragging if you&rsquo;ve done it. It is not a matter of learning to sell or any such, it is a matter of learning to be an owner.</p>

<h1>People Need to Learn to Notice and Recognize Contributions</h1>
 <p>Recognizing contributions is not as simple as it sounds. The usual &ldquo;contribution&rdquo; is work-related. The number of code check ins or the number of bags of concrete you brought in from the truck. All work-related. But talking to somebody who is down and lifting up her spirits is a major contribution.</p>
  <div class='_citation'>
   <p>R, the cleaning woman, went by picking up the stuff people had left behind on their desks the day before. There were only a handful of people in the office at the time, including a young woman who looked really down.</p>
   <p>When R came back around she started talking to the young woman. It was easy to listen in, so I did.</p>
   <p>It turned out that the young woman had a traumatic experience the night before. She had not slept much and decided to come to the office early instead of facing her walls. But here she was, facing the office walls. The conversation continued and went on for a while, but by the end the young woman said <span class='_quotespan'>Screw him. His loss.</span></p>
   <p>Now she was looking more like her usual self.</p>
  </div>
 <p>That was a major contribution,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>R noticed that somebody was not her usual self, and</li>
   <li>R engaged her in conversations.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>It was definitely a <em>major contribution</em> to the young woman and our community. If we had the <em>RADs! Mobile App</em> back then, I would have pressed the recognition button many times. Or perhaps not. That is why practice is necessary.</p>
 <p>If I were in the grip of my <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> cage I might have thought, &ldquo;<em>that was fantastic, but no, it doesn&rsquo;t equate to the amount of code I checked in yesterday</em>.&rdquo; In order to recognize all forms of contributions, we have to train ourselves out of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> cage and the <em>RADs! Mobile App</em> is the equipment for it.</p>

<h1>People Need to Learn to Give Pieces of the Company to Their Peers</h11>
      <td>
       <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world we live in, getting ownership in a business is a big, big deal. Many meetings happen, voices and tempers rise, and finally an agreement is cast in stone. After much grumbling the investor hands over cash and in exchange the business owner signs a stock certificate and gives it to the investor.</p>
       <p>In a company based on the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> foundation, everybody, every co-owner, gives away pieces of the company as they see fit. But this is a skill like any other, and we will have to learn it. We are the pioneers.  We, the children of <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>, have to learn to be leaders of <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-base alternatives.</p>

  <p>The <em>RADs! Mobile App</em> is deceptively simple to use, but it might just change the world by giving people a chance to live an alternative.</p>
