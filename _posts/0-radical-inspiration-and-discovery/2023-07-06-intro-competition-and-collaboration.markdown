     <p>Competition is another constant feature of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model. We learn to compete from the minute we are born. Kindergarten slows it down a little, but it comes back in full force in everything that follows. We pretend to listen, but we are really waiting for our chance to outcompete the previous speakers. Sometimes we are aggressive and sometimes we are meek, but underneath it all we compete in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. There are even debate clubs where we can practice our competitive skills.</p>
     <p>And, &ldquo;so?&rdquo; you ask, &ldquo;<em>what is wrong with that? We need to compete to survive</em>.&rdquo; But I see it as a way to divide people, as in divide and conquer. Them who win and they who lose. This makes it a lot easier for the powerful to just pay off enough of the winners.</p>
    <p>Democracy-by-voting probably was the best system in the 18th century, but here we are, 300 hundred years later in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Things have changed and we can do better now.</p>

     <p>Competition is a way of imposing your will. Cooperation is how you negotiate your will. Collaboration is the way to come up with acceptable goals. The people who can&rsquo;t live with these goals, have to come up with their own proposal. BTW, this is called <em>consent</em> by Sociocracy practitioners and as far as I know, they came up with it.</p>
    <p>We don&rsquo;t need to compete to survive. We need to compete to survive within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system where artificial, made up scarcity is used as a tool of force. This is what Marx never figured out. He just wanted a system where the workers were at the top and powerful at the bottom. Stalin named himself the representative of all workers and the rest is history: worker at the top and everybody else at the bottom.</p>
