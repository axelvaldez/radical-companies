 <p>Intro to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat System</span> and to the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical Foundation.</span>.</p>
</div>

<h1 clas='_section'>Fiat</h1>
  <p>Countries are <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> creations, straight out of kingdoms that had been cleansed by force.</p>
  <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to conquer the Americas, they waged their own cleansing campaign on their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act Catholic and speak Castilian (or else). The Inquisition stood as a merciless enforcer, ensuring obedience to the Church rules.</p>
  <p>By the time they got to what would be known as the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Had power over most of the peninsula and were extracting its wealth accordingly</li>
    <li>Had developed a methodology to cleanse out whatever other cultures they encountered</li>
    <li>They had what it took to subjugate, control, and obliterate anything that stood in their way.</li>
   </ul>

<h1>Divide and Conquer</h1>
 <p>At some point women were made the property of men and were made subservient to them. That is, for example, why inherited last names are the man&rsquo;s. The <em>ez</em> at the end of Spanish family names is the equivalent to the possessive English (<em>i.e.</em>, Pedro&rsquo;s) to indicate that it &ldquo;belongs to&rdquo; to the men. Men were the kings of their castle and women were reduced to chattel. Sounds comical, but there is an intuitive logic to it: men now had to worry about staying in control of what belonged to them, and not about the injustices from the powerful men above.</p>
 <p>It all was bundled with a strong ideology that created an institution and, surprisingly enough, women became pillars of it. Eve was the instigator of sin, and must submit for salvation. Women covered their hair, wore burkas, and relinquished their autonomy in the name of duty and survival.</p>

 <p>As Christianity spread by force of colonization, non-Europeans were made subservient to Europeans. Of course, there were wealthy non-Europeans, close to their colonial masters, and poor non-Europeans. The wealthier were even put in charge.</p>
 <p>We are still struggling with that attitude today, thousands of years later. We could be in paradise, but the woman enticed us to bite the apple of knowledge and poisoned us. We are still struggling with the leftovers of colonization, domestic and foreign. We are on our way to bring it all out in the open and heal the wounds, but it is a struggle as powerful people cling to the past.</p>

<h1>Lording</h1>
 <p>With men lording over half of the population, it was easier for a few men to lord over them. And they did. They could appeal to the stories and imagined history to support this convenient ideology that happened to support the making of kingdoms and empires.</p>
 <p>The Jewish tradition, Christianity, and Islam have an eternal, almighty, all powerful boss at the top. You would not dare to even think of yourself as equal to such power, you can only submit to it.</p>

<h1 clas='_section'>Radical</h1>
 <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to conquer the Americas, they waged their own cleansing campaign on their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act Catholic and speak Castilian (or else). The Inquisition stood as a merciless enforcer, ensuring obedience to the Church.</p>
 <p>By the time they got to the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla had developed a methodology to cleanse whatever other cultures they encountered—a tool to subjugate, control, and obliterate anything that stood in their way,</p>
 <p>In a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, there is no imposed hierarchy or divisions. If you believe in a supernatural world and supernatural beings, so be it, but the story of the omnipotent boss at the top doesn’t work for people anymore; in fact, that particular belief works against our survival as a species.</p>
 <p>The alternative is <em>not chaos</em>, but it is certainly different.</p>

<h1>Community</h1>
  <ul>
   <li>I trust my decentralized and fully transparent community.</li>
   <li>What is going to keep my community growing is what’s good for us.</li>
   <li>People in my community listen to me. They help make my ideas easier to understand. They help me find meaning.</li>
   <li>And if that is not the case, I leave.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Foundation</h1>
 <p>This is the Foundation of a community,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A community must help me find Meaning. This is a community that I want to Belong to.</li>
   <li>To work for every member, the community must be fully decentralized and transparent.</li>
   <li>Members are free to experiment. Not meeting the expected result, means that we learn how not to do it.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Alignment</h1>
 <p>But the Foundation is not enough, it needs an Explicit Alignment,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>To hold us together a community must define the <em>what for</em>, the Impact it wants to have on the world.</li>
   <li>It must be explicit about the <em>why</em>, its Purpose that made it come together as a community.</li>
   <li>The community can then define the <em>what, when,</em> and <em>how</em>, of each Mission of the work it needs to do.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>It is explicit in that it lays it all out for all to know; there are no dark corners where need-to-know information is kept away from view.</p>
 <p>It is alignment in the sense that it ties people together into a community with something in common.</p>
 <p>To be clear,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>If the <em>what for</em>, the Impact, is not your thing, then you don’t join the community. In theory it could be changed, but in practice it would make it a different community. It would be like transforming a hardware company into a software company. Sun Microsystems failed to continue as an independent business because it is very, very difficult.</li>
   <li>If the why, the Purpose, doesn’t work for you it is somewhat easier to change. Not a walk in the park, but easier to change. And if that doesn’t work, you don’t join the community.</li>
   <li>The what, when, and how, the Mission, changes all the time. People may be pursuing different Missions in parallel and you may join one of them. Or you may create your own with the support of the community.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>No Divisions</h1>
 <p>All members are co-owners of the result of the community’s work. If their goal is to build products or services it would be called a <em>company</em>,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>We are used to having businesses around. Their one and only goal is to create wealth for the owner. It may start with different ideals, but in the end it has got to make wealth for the owner. You work at a business for a wage agreed upon by the owner or his delegate.</li>
   <li>A company is a group of people that comes together as a community to improve the wellbeing of their members. We call these members co-owners. They own everything about the company, including its revenue. The level of co-ownership is not <em>equal</em>, as in co-ops, but it is equitable based on contributions.</li>
   <li>BTW, the word company comes from the Latin prefix “<em>co-</em>,” meaning <em>together</em>, and the Latin word “<em>-pan</em>,” meaning <em>bread</em>: <em>breaking bread together</em>.</li>
   <li>The level of co-ownership is determined by contributions, not capital.</li>
   <li>These contributions are recognized by other co-owners.</li>
  </ul>

<h1 clas='_section'>And&hellip;</h1>
 <p>And, yes, there is an app for that.</p>
