  <h2>What the Fiat System Does</h2>
   <p>If you are feeling overwhelmed by work, it is not a matter of working harder. That is what your boss tells you, and even your well-meaning co-workers. That is what every business book says, to search for excellence, acquire new habits to move up, and do more with less effort. But it is not you, it is the system that we call <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is designed to create more wealth for the owners and investors of the business you work for.</p>
   <p>The thing is that we created it, and we can create an alternative system, an alternative way of living.</p>
   <p>&ldquo;Fixing&rdquo; the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system would be never-ending because the system is too easy to game, particularly by powerful people. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system adapts to fixes very fast.</p>
   <p>Beware that alternatives to  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> are fundamentally different and will feel alien, idealistic, and even crazy. It will take more courage than you can imagine.</p>

   <p>If you are not open to this and are just being polite (&ldquo;<em>Sounds interesting, tell me more about it</em>&rdquo;), you are better off returning the book now. Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>
  <h2>What Does Fiat Even Mean?</h2>
   <p>You may not even know what the heck <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> means, but there is something, a feeling you have, that tells you that something is not quite right. And, you are correct in that it is not right, at all. Perhaps you are spending too much time at work. Or you are always ready to travel to a last-minute destination. Or maybe you have to do what would be three days&rsquo; worth of work in two, or one, hoping for an attaboy and maybe a reward. Don't worry, you will get a chance to rest when you get back, but the pile of work is bigger when you get back.</p>
   <p>Maybe you are fully aware of this or maybe you think that this is our destiny. But it is not &ldquo;our destiny.&rdquo; It is not even living. It is the way the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system limits us.</p>
   <p>We want to help make <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> visible, palpable, and how it is causing us the way we feel.</p>
  <h2>Fiat, the Word</h2>
   <p><span class='_quotespan'>But <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> it&rsquo;s a car.</span> And, indeed, FIAT as an acronym is the name of an Italian automobile car manufacturer that stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino</em>. Thus the acronym.</p>
   <p>But what does <em>the word</em> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> mean?</p>
   <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> money, for  example, is worth what each nation says it is (plus or minus what investors will pay for it). Money used to be an equivalent to gold, but that stopped in the 1970s. Now it is because the country says so (and nominally its economy).</p>
   <p>In the context of giving orders, the phrase additionally carries an implied threat: or else. "<em>Move those boxes from there to over there&hellip;  because I say so&hellip; or else).</em>&rdquo;</p>
  <h2>The System</h2>
   <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> environment, or more accurately, a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. Some people do not like the word system associated with their lives, and that is understandable. &ldquo;<em>My life is not limited by any system, I shape it however I want to.</em>&rdquo; Maybe &ldquo;ecology&rdquo; is more your thing, but an ecology is a system, too.</p>
   <p>We created the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and we uphold it. You have a boss, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. And within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, you work for a wage, but the wealth that you help create goes to the owner of the business you work for, not yourself. These are elements of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system that we created, we live in, and we uphold.</p>
   <p>Worse, the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is based on,</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Competition, not collaboration.</li>
     <li>Dividing people, not bringing us together.</li>
     <li>Threats, fear, force, and pain. Not wellbeing.</li>
    </ul>
   <p>Luckily, there are <em>alternatives</em> to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>
  <h2>It Starts with Rules</h2>
   <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to be pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Anybody with an addiction or a tick were at the edge as well.</p>
   <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to a pre-school. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotespan'>did you hit him back harder?</span>) and learn new ones (keep your hands to yourself).</p>
   <p>Lucky that we are, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. &ldquo;<em>That will be on the test!</em>&rdquo;</p>
   <p>Also, in primary school is when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>

    </div>
   <p>If we happen to live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simply fiddling with them and learning to make them more comfortable. No matter, we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off. We want to stay away from the people who don't know how to wear their glasses correctly.</p>
   <p>Finally, we go to work, with our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and how to be a good worker. We are happy to be a resource and happier that we are getting a steady wage (until—surprise—we are not).</p>
   <p><span class='_quotespan'>We learn to be kind and condescending to the ones whose glasses are skewed and not fitting correctly. We do our best for these people, but they just don&rsquo;t want to learn the rules. They want to live on the edge.</span></p>
  <h2>Fiat Is&hellip;</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Learning the rules,</li>
     <li>Following the rules,</li>
     <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
    </ul>
   <p>Think of what happens when you get caught not following the rules. Think of how many decisions you have made, now think of how you considered in the back of your head what your boss would think of them. Think of how many times you have said, <span class='_quotespan'>I am pretty sure that Bob is not going to like this.</span> You can&rsquo;t make a decision without considering Bob, your boss.</p>
   <p>You may be thinking, &ldquo;<em>How else would the system work? Think of decisions and how they have been influenced by what your boss would think of them. It is Bob or chaos. You do what you do, without thinking, because of Bob, your boss. This is encouraged by the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>
