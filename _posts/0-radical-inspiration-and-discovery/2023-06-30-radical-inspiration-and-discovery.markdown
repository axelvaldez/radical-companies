  <h2>What the Fiat System Does</h2>
   <p>If you are feeling overwhelmed by work, it is not a matter of working harder. That is what your boss tells you, and even your well-meaning co-workers. That is what every business book says, to search for excellence, acquire new habits to move up, and do more with less effort. But it is not you, it is the system that we call <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is designed to create more wealth for the owners and investors of the business you work for.</p>
   <p>The thing is that we created it, and we can create an alternative system, an alternative way of living.</p>
   <p>&ldquo;Fixing&rdquo; the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system would be never-ending because the system is too easy to game, particularly by powerful people. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system adapts to fixes very fast.</p>
   <p>Beware that alternatives to  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> are fundamentally different and will feel alien, idealistic, and even crazy. It will take more courage than you can imagine.</p>

   <p>If you are not open to this and are just being polite (&ldquo;<em>Sounds interesting, tell me more about it</em>&rdquo;), you are better off returning the book now. Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>

  <h2>What Does Fiat Even Mean?</h2>
   <p>You may not even know what the heck <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> means, but there is something, a feeling you have, that tells you that something is not quite right. And, you are correct in that it is not right, at all. Perhaps you are spending too much time at work. Or you are always ready to travel to a last-minute destination. Or maybe you have to do what would be three days&rsquo; worth of work in two, or one, hoping for an attaboy and maybe a reward. Don't worry, you will get a chance to rest when you get back, but the pile of work is bigger when you get back.</p>
   <p>Maybe you are fully aware of this or maybe you think that this is our destiny. But it is not &ldquo;our destiny.&rdquo; It is not even living. It is the way the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system limits us.</p>
   <p>We want to help make <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> visible, palpable, and how it is causing us the way we feel.</p>
  <h2>Fiat, the Word</h2>
   <p><span class='_quotespan'>But <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> it&rsquo;s a car.</span> And, indeed, FIAT as an acronym is the name of an Italian automobile car manufacturer that stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino</em>. Thus the acronym.</p>
   <p>But what does <em>the word</em> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> mean?</p>
   <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> money, for  example, is worth what each nation says it is (plus or minus what investors will pay for it). Money used to be an equivalent to gold, but that stopped in the 1970s. Now it is because the country says so (and nominally its economy).</p>
   <p>In the context of giving orders, the phrase additionally carries an implied threat: or else. "<em>Move those boxes from there to over there&hellip;  because I say so&hellip; or else).</em>&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>The System</h2>
   <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> environment, or more accurately, a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. Some people do not like the word system associated with their lives, and that is understandable. &ldquo;<em>My life is not limited by any system, I shape it however I want to.</em>&rdquo; Maybe &ldquo;ecology&rdquo; is more your thing, but an ecology is a system, too.</p>
   <p>We created the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and we uphold it. You have a boss, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. And within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, you work for a wage, but the wealth that you help create goes to the owner of the business you work for, not yourself. These are elements of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system that we created, we live in, and we uphold.</p>
   <p>Worse, the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is based on,</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Competition, not collaboration.</li>
     <li>Dividing people, not bringing us together.</li>
     <li>Threats, fear, force, and pain. Not wellbeing.</li>
    </ul>
   <p>Luckily, there are <em>alternatives</em> to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>

  <h2>It Starts with Rules</h2>
   <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to be pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Anybody with an addiction or a tick were at the edge as well.</p>
   <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to a pre-school. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotespan'>did you hit him back harder?</span>) and learn new ones (keep your hands to yourself).</p>
   <p>Lucky that we are, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. &ldquo;<em>That will be on the test!</em>&rdquo;</p>
   <p>Also, in primary school is when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>
    <div class='_center'>

      alt=''>
    </div>
   <p>If we happen to live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simply fiddling with them and learning to make them more comfortable. No matter, we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off. We want to stay away from the people who don't know how to wear their glasses correctly.</p>
   <p>Finally, we go to work, with our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and how to be a good worker. We are happy to be a resource and happier that we are getting a steady wage (until—surprise—we are not).</p>
   <p><span class='_quotespan'>We learn to be kind and condescending to the ones whose glasses are skewed and not fitting correctly. We do our best for these people, but they just don&rsquo;t want to learn the rules. They want to live on the edge.</span></p>

  <h2>Fiat Is&hellip;</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Learning the rules,</li>
     <li>Following the rules,</li>
     <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
    </ul>
   <p>Think of what happens when you get caught not following the rules. Think of how many decisions you have made, now think of how you considered in the back of your head what your boss would think of them. Think of how many times you have said, <span class='_quotespan'>I am pretty sure that Bob is not going to like this.</span> You can&rsquo;t make a decision without considering Bob, your boss.</p>
   <p>You may be thinking, &ldquo;<em>How else would the system work? Think of decisions and how they have been influenced by what your boss would think of them. It is Bob or chaos. You do what you do, without thinking, because of Bob, your boss. This is encouraged by the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>

 </div>

<h1 class='_section'>Fiat</h1>
  <p>Countries are <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> creations, straight out of kingdoms, cleansed by force.</p>
  <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to conquer the Americas, they waged their own cleansing campaign on their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act Catholic and speak Castilian (or else). The Inquisition stood as a merciless enforcer, ensuring obedience to the rules.</p>
  <p>By the time they got to what would be known as the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Had power over most of the Iberian peninsula and were extracting its wealth accordingly</li>
    <li>Had developed a methodology to cleanse out whatever other cultures they encountered</li>
    <li>They had what it took to subjugate, control, and obliterate anything that stood in their way.</li>
   </ul>

<div class='_h2heading'>

 <h2>Divide and Conquer</h2>
  <p>At some point women were made the property of men and were made subservient to them. That is, for example, why inherited last names are the man&rsquo;s. For exaple, the &ldquo;<em>ez</em>&rdquo; at the end of Spanish family names (<em>e.g.</em>, Per<em>ez</em>) is the equivalent to the English possessive (<em>e.g</em>, Pedro&rsquo;s). It indicated that people with that last name &ldquo;belonged to&rdquo; the man called Pedro. Men were the kings of their castle and everybody, including women, were reduced to chattel.</p>
  <p>Sounds comical now, but there is an intuitive logic to it: men, half the population, now had to worry about staying <em>in control</em> of what belonged to them, and not about the injustices from the powerful men above.</p>
  <p>It all was bundled with a strong ideology that created an institution and, surprisingly enough, women became pillars of it. Eve was the instigator of sin, and must submit for salvation. Women covered their hair, wore burkas, and relinquished their autonomy in the name of duty and survival.</p>

    </div>
   </div>
  <p>As Christianity spread by force of colonization, non-Europeans were made subservient to Europeans. Of course, there were wealthy non-Europeans, close to their colonial masters, and poor non-Europeans. The wealthier were even put in charge.</p>
  <p>We are still struggling with that attitude today, thousands of years later. We could be in paradise, but the woman enticed us to bite the apple of knowledge and poisoned us. We are still struggling with the leftovers of colonization, domestic and foreign. We are on our way to bring it all out in the open and heal the wounds, but it is a struggle as powerful people cling to the past.</p>

 <h2>Lording</h2>
  <p>With men lording over half of the population, it was easier for a few men to lord over them. And they did. They could appeal to the stories and imagined history to support this convenient ideology that happened to support the making of kingdoms and empires.</p>
  <p>The Jewish tradition, Christianity, and Islam have an eternal, almighty, all powerful boss at the top. You would not dare to even think of yourself as equal to such power, you can only submit to it.</p>

 <h2 class='_section'>Radical</h2>
  <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to conquer the Americas, they waged their own cleansing campaign on their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act Catholic and speak Castilian (or else). The Inquisition stood as a merciless enforcer, ensuring obedience to the Church.</p>
  <p>By the time they got to the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla had developed a methodology to cleanse whatever other cultures they encountered—a tool to subjugate, control, and obliterate anything that stood in their way,</p>
  <p>In a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, there is no imposed hierarchy or divisions. If you believe in a supernatural world and supernatural beings, so be it, but the story of the omnipotent boss at the top doesn’t work for people anymore; in fact, that particular belief works against our survival as a species.</p>
  <p>The alternative is <em>not chaos</em>, but it is certainly different.</p>

 <h2>Community</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>I trust my decentralized and fully transparent community.</li>
    <li>What is going to keep my community growing is what’s good for us.</li>
    <li>People in my community listen to me. They help make my ideas easier to understand. They help me find meaning.</li>
    <li>And if that is not the case, I leave.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>Foundation</h2 >
  <p>This is the Foundation of a community,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A community must help me find Meaning. This is a community that I want to Belong to.</li>
    <li>To work for every member, the community must be fully decentralized and transparent.</li>
    <li>Members are free to experiment. Not meeting the expected result, means that we learn how not to do it.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>Alignment</h2>
  <p>But the Foundation is not enough, it needs an Explicit Alignment,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>To hold us together a community must define the <em>what for</em>, the Impact it wants to have on the world.</li>
    <li>It must be explicit about the <em>why</em>, its Purpose that made it come together as a community.</li>
    <li>The community can then define the <em>what, when,</em> and <em>how</em>, of each Mission of the work it needs to do.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>It is explicit in that it lays it all out for all to know; there are no dark corners where need-to-know information is kept away from view.</p>
  <p>It is alignment in the sense that it ties people together into a community with something in common.</p>
  <p>To be clear,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>If the <em>what for</em>, the Impact, is not your thing, then you don’t join the community. In theory it could be changed, but in practice it would make it a different community. It would be like transforming a hardware company into a software company. Sun Microsystems failed to continue as an independent business because it is very, very difficult.</li>
    <li>If the why, the Purpose, doesn’t work for you it is somewhat easier to change. Not a walk in the park, but easier to change. And if that doesn’t work, you don’t join the community.</li>
    <li>The what, when, and how, the Mission, changes all the time. People may be pursuing different Missions in parallel and you may join one of them. Or you may create your own with the support of the community.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>No Divisions</h2>
  <p>All members are co-owners of the result of the community’s work. If their goal is to build products or services it would be called a <em>company</em>,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>We are used to having businesses around. Their one and only goal is to create wealth for the owner. It may start with different ideals, but in the end it has got to make wealth for the owner. You get paid whatever the boss feels is reasonable.</li>
    <li>A company is a group of people that comes together as a community to improve the wellbeing of their members. We call these members co-owners. They own everything about the company, including its revenue. The level of co-ownership is not <em>equal</em>, as in co-ops, but it is equitable based on contributions.</li>
    <li>BTW, the word company comes from the Latin prefix <span class='_quotespan''>co-,<span> meaning <em>together</em>, and the Latin word <span class='_quotespan''>-pan,</span> meaning <em>bread.</em> <em>Breaking bread together</em>.</li>
    <li>The level of co-ownership is determined by contributions, not capital.</li>
    <li>These contributions are recognized by other co-owners.</li>
   </ul>

</div>

<h1 class='_section'>And&hellip;</h1>
 <p>And, yes, there is an app for that.</p>
