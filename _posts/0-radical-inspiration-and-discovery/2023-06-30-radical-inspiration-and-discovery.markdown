 <h2>What the Fiat System Does</h2>
  <p>If you are feeling overwhelmed by work, it is not a matter of working harder. That is what your boss tells you, and even your well-meaning co-workers. That is what every business book says, to search for excellence, acquire new habits to move up, and do more with less effort. But it is not you, it is the system that we call <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is designed to create more wealth for the owners and investors of the business you work for.</p>
  <p>The thing is that we created it, and we can create an alternative system, an alternative way of living.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fixing&rdquo; the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system would be never-ending because the system is too easy to game, particularly by powerful people. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system adapts to fixes very fast.</p>
  <p>Beware that alternatives to  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> are fundamentally different and will feel alien, idealistic, and even crazy. It will take more courage than you can imagine.</p>

  <p>If you are not open to this and are just being polite (&ldquo;<em>Sounds interesting, tell me more about it</em>&rdquo;), you are better off returning the book now. Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>

 <h2>What Does Fiat Even Mean?</h2>
  <p>You may not even know what the heck <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> means, but there is something, a feeling you have, that tells you that something is not quite right. And, you are correct in that it is not right, at all. Perhaps you are spending too much time at work. Or you are always ready to travel to a last-minute destination. Or maybe you have to do what would be three days&rsquo; worth of work in two, or one, hoping for an attaboy and maybe a reward. Don't worry, you will get a chance to rest when you get back, but the pile of work is bigger when you get back.</p>
  <p>Maybe you are fully aware of this or maybe you think that this is our destiny. But it is not &ldquo;our destiny.&rdquo; It is not even living. It is the way the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system limits us.</p>
  <p>We want to help make <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> visible, palpable, and how it is causing us the way we feel.</p>

 <h2>Fiat, the Word</h2>
  <p><span class='_quotespan'>But <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> it&rsquo;s a car.</span> And, indeed, FIAT as an acronym is the name of an Italian automobile car manufacturer that stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino</em>. Thus the acronym.</p>
  <p>But what does <em>the word</em> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> mean?</p>
  <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> money, for  example, is worth what each nation says it is (plus or minus what investors will pay for it). Money used to be an equivalent to gold, but that stopped in the 1970s. Now it is because the country says so (and nominally its economy).</p>
  <p>In the context of giving orders, the phrase additionally carries an implied threat: or else. <span class='_quotespan'>Move those boxes from there to over there&hellip;  because I say so&hellip; or else).</span></p>

 <h2>The System</h2>
  <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> environment, or more accurately, a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. Some people do not like the word system associated with their lives, and that is understandable. <span class='_quotespan'>My life is not limited by any system, I shape it however I want to.</span> Maybe &ldquo;ecology&rdquo; is more your thing, but, alas, an ecology is a system, too.</p>
  <p>We created the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and we uphold it. You have a boss, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. And within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, you work for a wage, but the wealth that you help create goes to the owner of the business you work for, not yourself. These are elements of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system that we created, we live in, and we uphold.</p>
  <p>Worse, the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is based on,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Competition, not collaboration.</li>
    <li>Dividing people, not bringing us together.</li>
    <li>Threats, fear, force, and pain. Not wellbeing.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>Luckily, there are <em>alternatives</em> to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>

 <h2>It Starts with Rules</h2>
  <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to be pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Anybody with an addiction or a tick were at the edge as well.</p>
  <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to a pre-school. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotespan'>did you hit him back harder?</span>) and learn new ones (keep your hands to yourself).</p>
  <p>Lucky that we are, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. <span class='_quotespan'>That will be on the test!</span></p>
  <p>Also, in primary school is when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <img
     src='/assets/img/pic-leo-rayman-grow-and-avoid-green-washing.svg'
     width='70%'
     alt=''>
   </div>
  <p>If we happen to live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simply fiddling with them and learning to make them more comfortable. No matter, we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off. We want to stay away from the people who don't know how to wear their glasses correctly.</p>
  <p>Finally, we go to work, with our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and how to be a good worker. We are happy to be a resource and happier that we are getting a steady wage (until—surprise—we are not).</p>
  <p><span class='_quotespan'>We learn to be kind and condescending to the ones whose glasses are skewed and not fitting correctly. We do our best for these people, but they just don&rsquo;t want to learn the rules. They want to live on the edge.</span></p>

 <h2>Fiat Is&hellip;</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Learning the rules,</li>
    <li>Following the rules,</li>
    <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>Think of what happens when you get caught not following the rules. Think of how many decisions you have made, now think of how you considered in the back of your head what your boss would think of them. Think of how many times you have said, <span class='_quotespan'>I am pretty sure that Bob is not going to like this.</span> You can&rsquo;t make a decision without considering Bob, your boss.</p>
  <p>You may be thinking, <span class='_quotespan'>How else would the system work?</span> Think of decisions and how they have been influenced by what your boss would think of them. It is Bob or chaos. You do what you do, without thinking, because of Bob, your boss. This is encouraged by the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>

</div>

<h1 class='_section'>Countries and Other Divisions</h1>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
  <p>Countries are <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> creations, straight out of kingdoms, cleansed by force.</p>
  <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to conquer the Americas, they waged their own cleansing campaign on their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act Catholic and speak Castilian (or else). The Inquisition stood as a merciless enforcer, ensuring obedience to the rules.</p>
  <p>By the time they got to what would be known as the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Had power over most of the Iberian peninsula and were extracting its wealth accordingly</li>
    <li>Had developed a methodology to cleanse out whatever other cultures they encountered</li>
    <li>They had what it took to subjugate, control, and obliterate anything that stood in their way.</li>
   </ul>

<div class='_h2heading'>

 <h2>Divide and Conquer</h2>
  <p>At some point women were made the property of men and were made subservient to them. That is, for example, why inherited last names are the man&rsquo;s. For exaple, the <span class='_quotespan'>ez</span> at the end of Spanish family names (<em>e.g.</em>, Per<em>ez</em>) is the equivalent to the English possessive (<em>e.g</em>, Pedro&rsquo;s). It indicated that people with that last name &ldquo;belonged to&rdquo; the man called Pedro. Men were the kings of their castle and everybody, including women, were reduced to chattel.</p>
  <p>Sounds comical now, but there is an intuitive logic to it: men, half the population, now had to worry about staying <em>in control</em> of what belonged to them, and not about the injustices from the powerful men above.</p>
  <p>It all was bundled with a strong ideology that created an institution and, surprisingly enough, women became pillars of it. Eve was the instigator of sin, and must submit for salvation. Women covered their hair, wore burkas, and relinquished their autonomy in the name of duty and survival.</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <div class='_citation'>
     <p>The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don't turn against him, they crush those beneath them.</p>
     <p id='_signature'>Emily Bront&euml;</p>
    </div>
   </div>
  <p>As Christianity spread by force of colonization, non-Europeans were made subservient to Europeans. Of course, there were wealthy non-Europeans, close to their colonial masters, and poor non-Europeans. The wealthier were even put in charge.</p>
  <p>We are still struggling with that attitude today, thousands of years later. We could be in paradise, but the woman enticed us to bite the apple of knowledge and poisoned us. We are still struggling with the leftovers of colonization, domestic and foreign. We are on our way to bring it all out in the open and heal the wounds, but it is a struggle as powerful people cling to the past.</p>

 <h2>Lording</h2>
  <p>With men lording over half of the population, it was easier for a few men to lord over them. And they did. They could appeal to the stories and imagined history to support this convenient ideology that happened to support the making of kingdoms and empires.</p>
  <p>The Jewish tradition, Christianity, and Islam have an eternal, almighty, all powerful boss at the top. You would not dare to even think of yourself as equal to such power, you can only submit to it.</p>

</div>

<h1>Radical</h1>
  <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to conquer the Americas, they waged their own cleansing campaign on their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act Catholic and speak Castilian (or else). The Inquisition stood as a merciless enforcer, ensuring obedience to the Church.</p>
  <p>By the time they got to the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla had developed a methodology to cleanse whatever other cultures they encountered—a tool to subjugate, control, and obliterate anything that stood in their way,</p>
  <p>In a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, there is no imposed hierarchy or divisions. If you believe in a supernatural world and supernatural beings, so be it, but the story of the omnipotent boss at the top doesn’t work for people anymore; in fact, that particular belief works against our survival as a species.</p>
  <p>The alternative is <em>not chaos</em>, but it is certainly different.</p>

<div class='_h2heading'>

 <h2>Community</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>I trust my decentralized and fully transparent community.</li>
    <li>What is going to keep my community growing is what’s good for us.</li>
    <li>People in my community listen to me. They help make my ideas easier to understand. They help me find meaning.</li>
    <li>And if that is not the case, I leave.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>Foundation</h2 >
  <p>This is the Foundation of a community,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A community must help me find Meaning. This is a community that I want to Belong to.</li>
    <li>To work for every member, the community must be fully decentralized and transparent.</li>
    <li>Members are free to experiment. Not meeting the expected result, means that we learn how not to do it.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>Alignment</h2>
  <p>But the Foundation is not enough, it needs an Explicit Alignment,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>To hold us together a community must define the <em>what for</em>, the Impact it wants to have on the world.</li>
    <li>It must be explicit about the <em>why</em>, its Purpose that made it come together as a community.</li>
    <li>The community can then define the <em>what, when,</em> and <em>how</em>, of each Mission of the work it needs to do.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>It is explicit in that it lays it all out for all to know; there are no dark corners where need-to-know information is kept away from view.</p>
  <p>It is alignment in the sense that it ties people together into a community with something in common.</p>
  <p>To be clear,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>If the <em>what for</em>, the Impact, is not your thing, then you don’t join the community. In theory it could be changed, but in practice it would make it a different community. It would be like transforming a hardware company into a software company. Sun Microsystems failed to continue as an independent business because it is very, very difficult.</li>
    <li>If the why, the Purpose, doesn’t work for you it is somewhat easier to change. Not a walk in the park, but easier to change. And if that doesn’t work, you don’t join the community.</li>
    <li>The what, when, and how, the Mission, changes all the time. People may be pursuing different Missions in parallel and you may join one of them. Or you may create your own with the support of the community.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>No Divisions</h2>
  <p>All members are co-owners of the result of the community’s work. If their goal is to build products or services it would be called a <em>company</em>,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>We are used to having businesses around. Their one and only goal is to create wealth for the owner. It may start with different ideals, but in the end it has got to make wealth for the owner. You get paid whatever the boss feels is reasonable.</li>
    <li>A company is a group of people that comes together as a community to improve the wellbeing of their members. We call these members co-owners. They own everything about the company, including its revenue. The level of co-ownership is not <em>equal</em>, as in co-ops, but it is equitable based on contributions.</li>
    <li>BTW, the word company comes from the Latin prefix <span class='_quotespan''>co-,<span> meaning <em>together</em>, and the Latin word <span class='_quotespan''>-pan,</span> meaning <em>bread.</em> <span class='_quotespan'>Breaking bread together</span>.</li>
    <li>The level of co-ownership is determined by contributions, not capital.</li>
    <li>These contributions are recognized by other co-owners.</li>
   </ul>

</div>

<h1>And&hellip;</h1>
 <p>And, yes, there is an app for that.</p>

<h1 class='_section'>Capital vs Contributions</h1>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
  <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world we live in, the default is that the only way to contribute to a business is to invest capital in it. Said capital investment gives the investors power over the business. In the US investors don’t technically have any power over company operations. But there is a big, juicy loophole: they can replace the CEO. And they can keep replacing him until they find one that runs the operations according to their wishes. This only one of the side-effects of seeing capital as the only way to contribute.</p>
  <p>For one, power is force. So given their capital contribution, investors have power over the business. On the other hand, you have no ownership in the business and you are happy to get your salary, but that’s that. Owners have power over you.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
  <p>This is probably the most shocking thing about <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> alternatives: companies are not there to make founders and investors wealthy. Companies have to make money and be self-sustainable. But what usually goes into the pocket of the owners, now goes into the pockets of the co-owners, into the pockets of everybody who contributes to creating the wealth. If you are looking for yet another way to become wealthy, this ain&rsquo;t it. Companies are a way to increase the wellbeing of every co-owner and the society around them.</p>
  <p>Your level of co-ownership is determined by these contributions given to you by your co-owner peers. Your recognized contributions determine your level of co-ownership on a month to month basis. It is not static, it is dynamic. Next month it will most likely be different.</p>

<div class='_h2heading'>

 <h2>The Calculations</h2>
  <p>RADs make contributions tangible.</p>
  <p>You get a <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span> every day to give, not to keep. RADs are distributed based on what you recognize as contributions,</p>
  <p>As you give those RADs away, you are giving other people ownership in the company. No boss needed.</p>
  <p>The mobile app does all the calculations.</p>

 <h2>But&hellip;</h2>
  <p>At this point you may be coming up with objections, <span class='_quotespan'>Yeah, but it can be easily gamed: I&rsquo;ll give you all my <span class='_paradigm'>RADs</span> and you give me all of yours.</span></p>
  <p>And yes, it could, but only if the other co-owners do not say anything. Because of Transparency, they can see all the transactions and it is up to the co-owners to say or do something. They can have a conversation with people who seem to be trying to game the process. If they do not change their behavior, co-owners can decide to not recognize any of their contributions because they are doing something that makes co-ownership a joke.</p>
  <p>Another objection might be that people won&rsquo;t want to take the time to recognize contributions. They may do it at first, but then they will stop. Again, the data is there for all to see and if all co-owners stop recognizing contributions, then they won&rsquo;t get any more co-ownership, including the take of the revenue. They may slow down until they see the result and then, I hope, they will go back to doing it. If not, the company will fall apart. On the way to a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> alternative things won&rsquo;t go perfect or smoothly. There will be plenty of bumps along the way. The &ldquo;fix,&rdquo; in my opinion, is not to elect a boss to tell us what to do; the &ldquo;fix&rdquo; is to deal with what you consider a problem—you are all co-owners.</p>
  <p>An objection that I heard more than once is that <em>other</em> people are coin operated. They do not want to do anything for a community or society. &ldquo;Homo economicus&rdquo; is one of those convenient stories that popped up to support the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. People are not coin operated, but people have to survive and will go to kinds of lengths to do it. The thing to observe is that survival, though necessary, is not living.</p>

 <h2>Capital</h2>
  <p>Capital does have a place in a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> company, but it doesn&rsquo;t acquire power. A <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> Investment is more like an investment in that it carries the risk of non-payment and it is a loan in that the return is negotiated.</p>
  <p>Usually that capital goes to pay for,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Things needed by the company.</li>
    <li>To fund a Predictable Recurring Income (PRI) fund.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>The PRI</h2>
  <p>The PRI is used to pay co-owners a predictable, recurring income (like a salary) when there is little or no revenue. The PRI is paid back by the revenue each co-owner gets given their RADs. Until it is paid in full, what a co-owner takes out of the PRI fund is a personal debt. Once the PRI fund is paid, the upside (dividends) that would normally go to the owners and investors goes to the co-owners according to their RADs.</p>

 <h2>But&hellip;</h2>
  <p><span class='_quotespan'>But what about investing in the future? Owners don&rsquo;t put all the profits in their pocket, they invest it!</span></p>
  <p>Indeed many do, and co-owners can do the same. I make a distinction between profits and dividends, and the latter is what is left after paying all expenses, <em>including any investments</em>. For example, if the co-owners want to buy a $5M building, they would put up a <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> to accumulate that amount. They could decide to commit enough into the <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> to build up to $5M in three years. That amount is not to be included in the dividends.</p>

 <h2>Banners</h2>
  <p>Banners represent non-people things like projects and investments. With the RADs! mobile app you can, at minimum, create a <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span>, change your contribution to it, see who is contributing, and the beneficiaries.</p>
  <p>For the case where all co-owners agree, the <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> could look like this,</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <table style='width:80%; border:1px dotted #808080; '>
     <tr>
      <th style='background-color:yellow; text-align:left; width:50%; '><span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span>:</th>
      <th style='background-color:#22FFFF; text-align:left; width:50%; '>Contributions:</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td style='background-color:yellow; width:25rem; '>

      <td style='background-color:#22FFFF; width:25rem; '>All: $100.00</td>
     </tr>
    </table>
   </div>
  <p>Alternatively, all co-owners may not agree to commit any particular amount. In that case, the <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> would be funded by a subset of co-owners and when the building is bought the monthly rent would go to them according to their investment.</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <table style='width:80%; border:1px dotted #808080; '>
     <tr>
      <th style='background-color:yellow; text-align:left; width:50%; '><span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span>:</th>

<h1 class='_section'>Rules, Laws, and Force</h1>
 <p>Imagine a world where rules, initially upheld through conventions, eventually morph into cold, heartless <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> laws that leave us no choice but to comply. <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is a relentless force, bearing down on us with an iron grip.</p>

<div class='_h2heading'>

 <h2>Force</h2>
  <p>Picture this,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You get a traffic ticket. A very minor form of force.</li>
    <li>You have to give up money (<em>i.e.</em>, coined force) to be spared the pain that would follow if you don&rsquo;t.</li>
    <li>If you strongly feel that is an injustice, you let it go to court (<em>i.e.</em>, another type of force).</li>
    <li>Either you win or you lose,
     <ul>
      <li>Victory brings celebration, the force is with you.</li>
      <li>If you are defeated, you are angry, but you have to pay the ticket. Still a minor force.</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>On the other hand, if you happen to be from the edge, any sort of protest or disobedience may send you to prison. This is no longer a minor force.</li>
    <li>Behind those cold, unforgiving walls a fight may break out and blood is spilled and lives are maimed or lost. Either way, it is definitely a <em>force majeure.</em></li>
   </ul>
  <p>Force is ever present in our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. It goes from merely a frown to the ghastly specter of the electric chair.</p>
  <p>Withholding a reward because you did not say or did what was expected of you is a form of force. Getting passed over for a raise or promotion is a form of force. Firing you or laying you off is a form of force. Raising your rent so your only option is to leave is a form of force. We are surrounded by a system that runs on force, from threats to actual pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Motivation&rdquo; is another form of force. Do this and you&rsquo;ll get the reward. We often fail to see it for what it truly is—an external force, driving us toward someone else's desires. But you are being &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; to do what somebody else wants, regardless of what you may want to do. That is force.</p>
  <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>-base alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system there is no do-it-or-else force. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> myth is that without force we would never do anything of significance, we would never do anything bigger than ourselves. They try to shatter our belief in our own capabilities, in our power of our collective potential.</p>
  <p>But I ask you to consider this: humanity evolved and has survived and thrived as a species for a long time. We birthed agriculture, spreading its roots across every corner of the planet. We managed to do all that and more without anybody dictating our path, without anyone wielding force to mold us.</p>
  <p>Then came the people who took things by force, because they had nothing to trade. And then came money, coinage which allowed them to trade the wealth that they extracted from you by force. And slowly by surely the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system took shape around us.</p>
  <p>Alongside, there came the stories that supported the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system as it evolved,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>An all powerful supernatural being at the top</li>
    <li>Paradise</li>
    <li>Eve as the bad apple</li>
    <li>Homosexuals as abominations, pushed to the edge.</li>
    <li><span class='_quotespan'>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ,</span> from the Judeo-Christian Old Testament</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>Most Insidious</h2>
  <p>Most insidious of all, we learn to expect that the fruit of our work should go to someone else,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A god, an omnipotent being at the top</li>
    <li>A boss, an omnipotent being at the top.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>And that we get paid what the boss says is reasonable.</p>
  <p>It didn&rsquo;t start this way, but it evolved. First came prisoners of minor wars that were made to carry whatever the winners didn&rsquo;t want to carry, including the winners dead. At the end they either joined the winners (after all, they were related) or they went back to their village. Then came slavery, they kept you as a worthless worker because they had the force (and you were not related). Finally came wage work. From forced labor by sheer force to forced labor by coin. Different forms of force, but force throughout.</p>
  <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> tendrils extend deep into every aspect of our lives, particularly in the realms of economics and politics. For example, &ldquo;being a good worker&rdquo; is a sign of pride today within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system you and I live in. Unwavering loyalty to their chosen politicians, no matter the cost. There is nothing strange about it, it is totally normal. The alternative, they say, is chaos to be avoided at all costs.</p>
  <p>Anybody talking about alternatives (you and I) must be crazy. Ignore them.</p>
  <p>Organized religion has been part of the support system as well, but before we talk about that, we have to talk about divide-and-conquer.</p>

<h1 class='_section'>From Democracies to Dictatorships</h1>
 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model and its embedded force is at the root of all governance, from democracies to dictatorships. Can you think of a decentralized national government? I can&rsquo;t, either, because it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>I have already said a lot about <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. One thing I mentioned in passing is that <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> evolved into the complex mess it is today. For example, the Christian Bible admonished slaves to &ldquo;obey your earthly masters.&rdquo; However, when outright slavery went out the door, that stopped being acceptable language (though the majority of women and children to this day still have to obey their earthly masters).</p>
  <p>The thing that has remained constant in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is Force.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>As opposed to <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>, <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> is a Foundation of what we need at the root of the system (<em>i.e.</em>, in yellow, below), not a system that has evolved to be a big, hairy ball of hair. <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> does not have embedded rules and it is not dogmatic in any way,</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <img

    width='70%'
    alt=''>
  </div>
 <p> When looking for solutions to what we feel is wrong, we often get lost in the intellectual weeds and point to the first obvious thing. We never get beyond this point and we end up never discovering what&rsquo;s really at the root of the problem. The <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> Foundation helps us remain clear,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Will this decision make us more or less decentralized? Either choice is up to you and your community, but the Foundation helps you know which direction the decision is  taking you.</li>
   <li>Will this decision make it easier to help people find meaning in what they are doing or not? Again, either choice is up to you and your community, but the Foundation helps you know where you are headed.</li>
    <p>You may be leaning one way, but rethink it once you realize where it would take you. What you definitely will not be able to do is hide behind, <span class='_quotespan'>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know!</span></p>
    <p><span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> doesn&rsquo;t come with rules out of the box, but you and the community of people you work with can come up with any rules you want; without Force. You are all co-owners  and none of you have the right to Force to others.</p>
  </ul>

<h1 class='_section'>Competition and Collaboration</h1>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>Competition is another constant feature of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model. We learn to compete from the minute we are born. Kindergarten slows it down a little, but it comes back in full force in everything that follows. We pretend to listen, but we are really waiting for our chance to outcompete the previous speakers. Sometimes we are aggressive and sometimes we are meek, but underneath it all we compete in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. There are even debate clubs where we can practice our competitive skills.</p>
 <p>And, &ldquo;so?&rdquo; you ask, &ldquo;<em>what is wrong with that? We need to compete to survive</em>.&rdquo; But I see it as a way to divide people, as in divide and conquer. Them who win and they who lose. This makes it a lot easier for the powerful to just pay off enough of the winners.</p>
 <p>Democracy-by-voting probably was the best system in the 18th century, but here we are, 300 hundred years later in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Things have changed and we can do better now.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>Competition is a way of imposing your will. Cooperation is how you negotiate your will. Collaboration is the way to come up with acceptable goals. The people who can&rsquo;t live with these goals, have to come up with their own proposal. BTW, this is called <em>consent</em> by Sociocracy practitioners and as far as I know, they came up with it.</p>
 <p>We don&rsquo;t need to compete to survive. We need to compete to survive within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system where artificial, made up scarcity is used as a tool of force. This is what Marx never figured out. He just wanted a system where the workers were at the top and powerful at the bottom. Stalin named himself the representative of all workers and the rest is history: worker at the top and everybody else at the bottom.</p>

<h1 class='_section'>Scarcity and Abundance<h1>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>Food scarcity ended centuries ago, as soon as agriculture started to mix in with hunting and gathering. But then, agriculture brought in land scarcity. At least, that&rsquo;s how the story goes.</p>
 <p>Actually, what agriculture brought about was land enclosures. An enclosure is when somebody takes, by force, over land that was previously communal and provided for all. After the enclosure, if you want to use the land, you have to render goods.</p>
 <p>Abundance for a few, scarcity for everybody else.</p>
 <p>In the Fiat system, abundance creates scarcity. Abundance brings out the forces to enclose and creates scarcity for the rest of us. For example, the newest abundant good is the so-called AI computing. It is abundant because it evolved in the Open Source space (free, as in beer), but some people would like to <em>enclose</em> that technology with regulation (force). People like Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX, Sam Altman, OpenAI, Kent Walker, SVP at Google, Mustafa Suleyman, Co-founder of DeepMind, Francesca Rossi, Global Leader at IBM Research are lobbying the US Congress for regulation that would amount to enclosure.</p>
 <p>Abundance for a few, scarcity for everybody else, 21<sup>st</sup> century style.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>Enclosures do come out of Force and Force is a no-no in <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based alternatives.</p>
 <p>We can&rsquo;t fix history, but we can choose our future. And we can choose a future where abundance is the rule, not the exception-until-somebody-figures-out-how-to-exploit-it.</p>
 <p>We must lead the way to such a future. It won&rsquo;t be easy and there will be many obstacles in the way. Many will come from inside us, children-of-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> that we are. Nevertheless, we need to make it happen.</p>

<h1 class='_section'>Pain vs Wellbeing</h1>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model is based on Pain and people have gotten used to avoiding pain and surviving.</p>
 <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system a Threat is usually enough to get compliance. If not, Force and Pain will rear their ugly heads.</p>

<h1>Who Am I If Not a Manager?</h1>
 <div class='_citation'>
  <p>When we talk to people about going <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> at their company, many perceive an existential threat to managers. <span class='_quotespan'>If you are getting rid of my job type, then you are getting rid of me.</span></p>
  <p>Ironically, managers can be the happiest abandoning their titles and becoming co-owners with their former employees. People who are today "managers" will benefit the most by going <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> because they are currently boxed up by the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> hierarchy.</p>

<h1>Surviving Is Not Living</h1>
 <div class='_citation'>
  <p>First, I jumped into the void, past my fears. I was hoping to go through it safely. Instead I came out stronger, with a positive view of life. It was a blind jump, but I discovered the light in my life.</p>
  <p>I am not split between my &ldquo;personal&rdquo; live and my "work" life. I am one and the same no matter what I am doing.</p>
  <p>I was surviving, not living. But now I can recognize the fears that held me in survival mode. I can go around them, lovingly, and go on with my life, guiding me, not my fears. I am still afraid, but I am living my life. The more I do it, the easier it gets. I am not afraid of dying, so I am not afraid of living.</p>
  <p>Nobody knows how to live my life better than myself. Nobody, besides me, knows what's best for me.</p>

<h1 class='_section'>We Remember, Therefore We Are<h1>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>We remember what makes us feel something, anything: the horrific, the joyful.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> We dont&rsquo;t remember specific words or actions, but we dont&rsquo;t forget what was so hurtful or what was lovingly said.</p>
 <p>This is what came up after reading <em>Consciousness as a Memory System</em>. It describes the authors&rsquo; theory of &ldquo;conciousness as memory,&rdquo;</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  Consciousness is directed toward an object; it is about something (ie, intentionality). We experience consciousness as unified, as one experience, rather than as separate experiences of sights, sounds, smells, thoughts, feelings, and so on (<em>ie</em>, unity). We have the capacity to be conscious of some things and not others (<em>ie</em>, selectivity). Objects of consciousness are there transiently; the contents of consciousness tend to change (<em>ie</em>, transience).

 </div>
 <p>After reading <em>Conciousness</em>, I went to sleep with a lot of questions bouncing in my head. How do we choose what we remember vs what we never commit to memory? What urges us to spend the energy of building one memory and not another? I believe that what guides us is our feelings.</p>

<h1 class='_section'>I Am Giving My All to My Dreams<h1>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>There are certain industries where people are very willing to take a massive hit to their capacity for independent action in exchange for working on their dreams. The NewSpace and Video Game industries are two that pop to mind where,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Fealty to the vision is explicit as the ability to overwork yourself,</li>
  <li>The ability to work late into the evening.</li>
  <li>The expectation that you are going to get beers with the coworkers after work.</li>
  <li>Coming in on Saturdays (good if your boss asks, but even better if you do it of your own volition).</li>
  <li>It represents itself as crunch time, where you work intensely long hours.</li>
</ul>
 <p>You forego every other aspect of your life. The results are burnout, disenfranchisement, and the ignoring of your relationships.</p>

<h1>Dreams and Burnout</h1>
 <p>For businesses, burnout is a huge problem. There is lots of talk about it, but it is mostly lip service. Solving burnout requires challenging the whole <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> structure of business, not just a silly HR campaign or a meditation retreat.</p>
 <p>At the foundation of burnout is the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> structure. You have to work more because I say so. I own more of this company or I am higher up in the ranks and I get to tell you what to do.</p>
 <p>The NewSpace industry exploits the fact that it can abuse you because you dream of going to Space. Same for the Video Game industry: these businesses know that you dream to bring the same joy to others that you enjoyed when you were younger.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>It is an honor to work at Google because it represents the cream of the crop of engineering.</li>
  <li>It is an honor to work at SpaceX, not just because of the pedigree, but you also get to work on your childhood dreams.</li>
  <li>It is an honor to work at Blizzard and any other giant of an industry that runs on burning through idealistic engineers.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>In each of these companies, people are willing to put in life-debilitating efforts to work there. At the time, they might tell themselves this is the price for working on their dreams. Unfortunately, they will eventually meet the version of themselves that leaves the industry entirely, gets divorced, end us alienated from their children, or/and develops a mental illness.</p>
 <p>The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> model avoids this problem. In a <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> company everyone is working in concert with each other and there are no bosses to tell you to work on the weekend.</p>

<h1>Overdoing It</h1>
 <p>You can still work on the weekend, maybe because that is what you are used to. Your dreams and the joy of their pursuit are your &ldquo;boss,&rdquo; prodding you to do it. But you are not the only one paying the price of manic work. Your coworkers pay for it, too.</p>
 <p>In a <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> environment, your co-worker has the ability and skill to tell you that she does not like seeing you work to exhaustion for weeks on end. And she doesn&rsquo;t like you texting her in the evening because it puts pressure on her to overwork and sacrifice her health, her relationship. The ability to talk to your co-workers directly, not through your boss, is one of the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> foundations.</p>

<h1>RADs</h1>
 <p>It&rsquo;s not just ideals: <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> brings along practices and tools, too. In a <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> company, she and other co-workers can make this feedback tangible to you. With <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s, they can reward you for things they like or they can stop giving you <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s if you continue on a path that doesn&rsquo;t work for them. The <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> distribution creates the conditions for different conversations to take place.</p>
 <p>In our current, <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> world, your coworker might say something, but it won&rsquo;t really be tangible. Only your boss matters.</p>

<h1>Pursuing Your Dream</h1>
 <p>You very well might work at a <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> company where everyone decides they prefer to work on the weekends or at odd hours. Or maybe your team decides to work this way. People can do any of these because everyone is a co-owner.</p>
 <p>If during the discussion, somebody brings up that the odd hours may cause burnout, &ldquo;and that will cost us,&rdquo; you all, as co-owners, have to consider that, discuss it, and make a decision. If you decide on an odd-hour work schedule, then you&rsquo;ll have to bring it upfront to potential new co-owners and only people that find that energizing will join. That may be a price you&rsquo;re willing to pay.</p>
 <p>The point is that there are many paths to pursuing your dreams and co-owners can set their own course through explicit conversations. You can choose your path without having to pay the personal cost of not finding a partner, neglecting your dog, or eating your stress.</p>

<h1 class='_section'>The Boss Inside Your Head<h1>

<h1></h1>
 <p>We talk a lot about getting rid of bosses inside a company, but what about the one inside your head? This is probably the most pernicious manager of all, the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; voice. The one demanding, telling you to do it this or that and limiting your capacity for creative action.</p>
 <p>This &ldquo;boss&rdquo; is to some extent our parents and teachers, people who needed us to do things &ldquo;for your own good.&rdquo; But we are adults now. Why is the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; voice still around? And, is it actually operating &ldquo;for your own good?&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Does our &ldquo;boss&rdquo; voice make us healthier and happier? Does it even make us wealthier? I’m willing to bet that, ironically, it causes the opposite. For many of us, that voice is out of control. Not seeing the results it wants, it ups the volume and we become resentful and stressed, rather than getting positive outcomes.</p>

<h1>The Other Voice</h1>
 <p>We need to transition from that voice being &ldquo;the boss&rdquo; and instead treat it as being one of our associates in an equal relationship.</p>
 <p>The first step is to acknowledge we are not solely that voice. The &ldquo;boss&rdquo; voice is recommending things it thinks will minimize pain and get us things. It uses a lot of &ldquo;should&rdquo; statements, like, &ldquo;I should invest&rdquo; or &ldquo;I should ask for a raise.&rdquo; Maybe it’s more aggressive, &ldquo;Clean the sink!&rdquo; or &ldquo;You don’t deserve success, you can barely take care of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>The &ldquo;boss&rdquo; voice wants to be at the top of our internal hierarchy. It wants us to get to the position it thinks we deserve. But there is another voice, one that we do not nurture enough. And that is the call to spontaneity and freedom.</p>
 <p>Interestingly, the warnings against being personally spontaneous are the same that come up when thinking about taking a company RADICAL. Is the same cacophony of fears: It will be chaos; You are dreaming.</p>
 <p>You can dull the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; voice, by empathizing with it. Listen to it and acknowledge that it is coming from fear. Then let the other voice speak for spontaneity and freedom.</p>
 <p>For example, here is what happened to me recently,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The &ldquo;boss&rdquo; voice said, &ldquo;I <em>should</em> go to the salad place because it is healthier,&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Oh, that’s coming from fear.</li>
  <li>Then, the other voice said, &ldquo;Actually, I really could do anything.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>This opened me up to realize that I needed a little nap before I went to lunch.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>If I had let that &ldquo;boss&rdquo; voice dominate me, I would have been resentful and might have even ended up  at the burger place. As it was, I took a nap and went to the poke place which was a lot more fun. I discovered my fatigue, which was almost crowded out by the demands I was placing on myself. And I still ate healthy.</p>

<h1>People & Company</h1>
 <p>Think of times in your life that were really great. Was the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; voice really active and dominant during those times? Probably not.</p>
 <p>It turns out that when you give yourself freedom, you are kinder to yourself and then kinder to others. And the stress comes off.</p>
 <p>And guess what, those adulting things you were delaying on are now easier to do. You find a locus of calm and strength to operate from. The &ldquo;boss&rdquo; voice may at times serve you, especially if there is an emergency and action is demanded. If the building is burning then by all means demand of yourself to put out the fire. But the rest of the time—the vast majority of time—the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; inside you is actually a hindrance, not just to happiness, but your best self.</p>
 <p>Choose to be free, not just in your organization, but  inside yourself as well. In fact, you can’t do one without the other.</p>

<h1 class='_section'>Investing for Wellbeing, Not Just Wealth<h1>

<h1>One on the Left, One on the Right</h1>
 <p>The two people walking in front of me were talking about what they wished existed. They seem to have some money to invest, but they didn&rsquo;t dare do so. The person on my left suggested to the one on my right to invest in <span class='_quotespan'>somebody you know, maybe someone in your family?</span</p>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>But,</span> responded the right person, <span class='_quotespan'>I don&rsquo;t have anybody like that!</span></p>
 <p>Person on the left laughed and said, <span class='_quotespan'>Well, neither do I. And I don&rsquo;t have that much to invest, either.</span></p>
 <p>A bit later, the person on the left brought up “community” and the person on the right said, <span class='_quotespan'>yes, right, I wish I knew where my money went. The big funds end up investing in things I don&rsquo;t like. They invest in a clean business, but it owns another business and it owns another business that sells some crap like vaporizers.</span>. And, oh, the irony: she said this just as they were walking in front of a store that sold <em>CBT vapes</em>.</p>
 <p>A bit later they walked ahead as I got to where I was going.</p>

<h1>Radical Investments</h1>
 <p>As they were talking I kept thinking that <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> investments addressed their issues. <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> investments fail like investments (<em>i.e.</em> if the company does not make it, the money is gone), but they look like loans in that you get a return on your money. The latter could range from a percentage of the investment amount to a percentage of revenue for some time. No matter, there are no shares and you don&rsquo;t have any other powers over the company. This sounds a lot like what is commonly known as a friends-family-and-fools investment, the foundation of which is trust.</p>
 <p>The foundation of a <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> investment is trust as well. <span class='_quotespan'>But,</span>; the counter goes, <span class='_quotespan'>there is not enough trust in the world to fund all the unicorns that are coming up.</span> Indeed, many of these have lost their horns and are no longer unicorns. In any case, those are capital investments, purely for wealth. Whether or not they contribute to the health of the community don&rsquo;t matter, these investments are made exclusively to generate wealth. <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> investments are made to generate wellbeing, and some wealth.</p>

<h1>Wellbeing Comes First</h1>
 <p>Wealth generation almost invariably comes at the cost of the wellbeing of the founders, that of the &ldquo;ground floor&rdquo; employees, and the wellbeing of the community as well. As one upset Board member put it, <span class='_quotespan'>Your job is to leverage our investment. Otherwise, you are not going to get anything for all the effort you and your crew are putting in!</span> Scary words which you take as a warning that you&rsquo;d better listen to and do what you have to do to <span class='_quotespan'>leverage their investment,</span> even if it costs you your wellbeing, your family&rsquo;s, and that of you &ldquo;your crew&rdquo; (<em>i.e.</em>, your friends).</p>
 <p>From that perspective, the wellbeing of your community does not count. And as we now know, the wellbeing of our environment, our life support system, has been the loser as we chase wealth.</p>
 <p>As a practice supported by the <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> system, <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> investments do not put pressure (<em>i.e.</em>, force) on co-owners. And because of this, these investments are robust, long lasting, and make the odds of financial success higher. And all of this without the cost to wellbeing to companies or their communities.<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>

<h1 class='_section'>Disentangling Investments<h1>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>This, too, shall pass, but for now, you need <em>capital</em>.</p>
 <p>How else are you going to get your business started? How else are you going to hire the people who are going to build your software? At least, you don&rsquo;t have to pay for office space now, but you still need a budget for socializing spaces (<em>i.e.</em>, because socializing is very important to the team health)</p>
 <p>So, yes, you need capital. But what does that even mean? You need to learn more about it and what it entails.</p>

<h1>The Money Folks</h1>
 <p>You went to a bank but it turned out that they loan money against assets that are worth as much as the loan. They play it safe, but you get the capital in one big lump. Unfortunately, you don&rsquo;t have any safe assets to offer. If you were an established business you&rsquo;d have a revenue stream to offer, but you don&rsquo;t have that, either. So, scratch banks.</p>
 <p>Next on the list is Angels. Essentially, wealthy people who have been through a similar experience and feel some sympathy for you. They can put up some of the money you need and, if you convince enough of them, you can get your new business going.</p>
 <p>Right below them are the VCs, so you talk to a few of them to see if you can skip the Angels altogether. They are very nice, but essentially they tell you that you need “market fit” before  we can make an investment. “We are responsible, y’know, to our Limited Partners. So, you&rsquo;d better off going the Angel route for now.”</p>

<h1>Disentangling Investments</h1>
 <p>Angels trade the money for a “promissory note.” They do promise to either return you capital plus a percentage of it or issue you shares, once the VCs step up to the table.</p>
 <p>Notice that there are no shares and no Board at this point. Some Angels also act like advisors, but that is very different from a Board empowered by capital.</p>
  <div class="_center">

    alt="A circle with one arrow going in, labeled 'High hopes and enthusiasm' and one arrow going out, labeled 'Promisory note.'"

  </div>
 <p>VCs are different,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <img
    src="/assets/img/ins-and-outs-vcs.svg"
    alt="A circle with three arrows going in, representing inputs. From top to bottom, 1) 'Market Fit' service or product, 2) High hopes and enthusiasm, and 3) Early clients. The outputs are, from top to bottom, 1) Seed or A-round high risk cash, 2) A pool of (non-voting) shares for early employees, 3) term sheet, and 4) Board of Directors seat for each investor."
    width="70%">
  </div>
 <p>The big difference is that those Board of Director seats give the VCs control of your business (<em>i.e.</em>, really, control of <em>you</em>). And, legal fantasies aside, through you, or your replacement, they have control of the business. Lots of people would differ and they will bring up this and that reason for why that is not <em>quite</em> the case. But it&rsquo;s a fantasy, a myth for sleeping better at night, subtleties required by the law of the land but which make no difference if the Board wants to fire your ass.</p>
 <p>This is, at least, how it works in the technology business. Other business areas work differently.</p>
 <p>For example, the real estate business investment acts more like a riskier loan, IMO. The real asset doesn&rsquo;t exist yet, you have to build it. So, you put together several Angel-like investors  to raise the money you need to buy materials and hire the people to put them all together into a real estate asset (<em>e.g.</em>, an office building, a residential development, a hotel).</p>
 <p>The risk is that the developer fails to finish the asset and you lose the money you invested. The Return on that Investment (ROI) is usually a percent of the profits. Kind of like a forever annuity.</p>

<h1>Radical Investments</h1>
 <p>These are a combination of Angel investments and real estate investment. They return the principal investment plus,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>a percentage or multiple of it</li>
   <li>a single-digit percent of profit (<em>i.e.</em>, an annuity).</li>
   </ul>
 <p>In either case, a RADICAL investment never includes any type of <em>control</em> or <em>Board seat.</em></p>

<h1>An Experiment</h1>
 <p>You can experiment with a small investment or even money that you are putting up out of your own pocket. This will serve to get everybody comfortable with how it works. Keep in mind that every co-owner will be part of honoring the terms of the investment.</p>
 <p>The first thing to keep present is that this is an investment and if things go belly up with the company,<a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> that money is gone. When things go well, the investment money and profits are paid according to the terms. Let&rsquo;s say the agreement is to pay back twice the principle, say, $100,000 within 48 months. In that case you need to accumulate $200K in the next 48 months.</p>
 <p>There are at least two ways to treat debt repayment: as an company obligation or as an obligation of the present co-owners. As a company obligation it applies to present <em>and future</em> co-owners; otherwise, it is treated as an obligation to current co-owners via a <span class="_paradigm">Banner</span>. An investment can only be treated as a company obligation because the result (<em>i.e.</em>, company growth) benefits all co-owner, current and future.</p>
 <p>As a company obligation, the repayment is taken out of revenue (<em>i.e.</em>, it is not included in the earned dividends).<a href="#en05"><sup id="bm05">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> You may decide to put away $8,334 (<em>i.e.</em>, 1/24<sup>th</sup> of $200K) every month into a repayment fund; alternatively, you could put away a percentage of revenue every month and as revenue grows, the amount put away will grow as well. In any case, by the end of the 48 months all present and future co-owners would have sacrificed a portion of their earned dividends to repay the investment.</p>

<h1 class='_section'>Disentangling Management<h1>

<h1>The Hierarchy</h1>
 <h2>The Big Boss</h2>
  <p>You have to distinguish between the CEO and every other manager, or as well call them the Big Boss and Lesser Bosses.</p>
  <p>The Big Boss could be any of,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A founder (<em>e.g.</em>, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos)</li>
   <li>A career Lesser Boss (<em>e.g.</em>, Tim Cook, Andy Jassy) who is elevated to Big Boss.</li>
   <li>A monied type who elevates himself to Big Boss (<em>e.g.</em>, Elon Musk).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Big Boss sits at the top of the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> hierarchy, the boss of the Lesser Bosses.</p>
 <h2>The Lesser Bosses</h2>
  <p>No matter the size of the business, the Lesser Bosses compete with each other more or less furiously. There are exceptions to this, but this is the norm; the exceptions are few and far between.</p>

<h1>The Big Boss</h1>
 <h2>Rasing Capital</h2>
  <p>Raising capital is the job of the Big Boss, but oftentimes a Board member or two get it done. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll <em>help</em> you with that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This always happens at the start of the business. Later it may happen when</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The Board pushes for <em>growth</em> and new investors are sought to provide the cash. If this is a <em>down round</em>, Board members agree to be diluted (<em>i.e.</em>, to have their shares do down in value) given that without the extra cash they may be financially screwed.</li>
    <li>A Board member wants to partially cashout. He sells some of his shares to another investor and he, not the business, gets the cash</li>
    <li>If a Board member wants to fully cash out, the euphemism is that he is &ldquo;leaving his Board seat to pursue other projects.&rdquo;. The business may or may not get any cash out of these types of transactions.</li>
   </ul>
 <h2>Hiring</h2>
  <p>Putting together the Executive team is way up there in the Big Boss&rsquo; job description; it goes right under &rdquo;make money&rdquo; for the Board and the stockholder.</p>
  <p>If you are within striking distance of an IPO or some other &ldquo;liquidity event,&rdquo; you hire a bunch of people with <em>bona fide</em> credentials from well known companies. You name them CxOs because a big part of your IPO story is having &ldquo;a strong team.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If you are far from IPO, or past it, you want to hire an &ldquo;effective&rdquo; team, no matter how they go about it, even if they go about it ruthlessly. And when it comes to finances they will get you what you need one way or the other.</p>
  <p>In a smaller company, the Big Boss&rsquo; main job is to raise money and set strategy. So, he hires an executive team who can take care of everything else. These folks are mostly competent and even nice (but they are their way of being neither).</p>
 <h2>Firing</h2>
  <p>It may be distasteful. It may be a mark against the Big Boss, &ldquo;He made a mistake, he should have never hired such a duffus.&rdquo; Or it may be something to be proud of, &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t hesitate! This guy can really execute.&rdquo; In any case, it is usually not a big deal as the Lesser Boss is given a generous severance in exchange for a signed promise not to sue the business.</p>
 <h2>Strategy</h2>
  <p>Whether they think of it or they &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; it from someone else, the Big Boss sets the strategy, which is how the company is going to grow the business and make a bigger profit.</p>

<h1>The Lesser Bosses</h1>
 <h2>Hiring</h2>
  <p>Except for their direct staff, the Lesser Bosses get involved in hiring just in case their boss asks. They really add no value to the process. In fact, they slow it down. After wasting a lot of time and effort accommodating the boss, and the delays that introduces, he does a very short &ldquo;interview&rdquo; and renders a final decision to hire or not. This happens after extensive interviewing by the team, people who know the subject matter well and are going to work with the candidate. Many Lesser Bosses go with the team&rsquo;s decision, but others don&rsquo;t, because &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like her&hellip; attitude&hellip; tattoos&hellip; questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a co-managed company,<a href="#en06"><sup id="bm06">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> the people who are going to team up with the candidate make the final decision to hire or not. They may even do away with the interview altogether because the candidate is not just a vessel of cognitive skills, the rest of her comes along with it, and her contributions come from her whole person.</p>
 <h2>Firing</h2>
  <p>Firing is usually left to the Lesser Boss. Many of them dislike doing it, so they ignore it or postpone doing it until things come to a head. In a co-managed company, the team can eject a person and tell him the reasons why directly. No boss needed.</p>
 <h2>Mediating Conflict</h2>
  <p>The Lesser Bosses are often called to play referee. If there&rsquo;s a conflict between people, he gets in the middle of it and does his best to arrive at a clean break. This general does not resolve the issue, not really, but everybody can go to their own corners to work.</p>
  <p>In a co-managed company, either people resolve the issue themselves by bringing it up and talking through it, or they involve a third person (<em>i.e.</em>, a tried) and the three of them resolve it. Additionally, they all learn new skills for how to resolve this type of issue and, more importantly, new language to keep it from becoming a problem.</p>
 <h2>Defending You from Other Bosses</h2>
  <p>Each department in a business is like a feudal dominion, with a castle in the middle surrounded by fields under its protection. It has a moat around it and you work the fields in exchange for protection (plus a paycheck in modern times). The would-be attackers are the other bosses, and sometimes the people, in the other castles&hellip; er&hellip; departments. The knight in white armor &ldquo;defending&rdquo; you is your boss. As you can imagine, this becomes an obstacle to collaboration and it has a major, negative impact on the business.</p>
 <h2>Implementing Tactics</h2>
  <p>Technically, the Lesser Bosses set the tactics to implement the Big Boss strategy.</p>
  <p>In reality, the thing that counts the most is the financial goals. The grander strategy may or may not align with the profit-making goals, but when in doubt, make sure to meet the profit goals.</p>
  <p>You are the proverbial cog and your job is to implement the profit-making goals.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, you usually have no idea and no way to find out how what you do connects to the profit-making goals, or the tactics, or the strategy. So, you fall back on doing whatever your boss says to do. Everything else is a black box to you (and oftentimes to the Lesser Bosses, too).</p>
  <p>In a co-managed company, everything about the company is transparent. So you can figure out how what you do ties to your company&rsquo;s sustainability (<em>i.e.</em>, financials, strategy, tactics, etc.).</p>
 <h2>Other Things&hellip;</h2>
  <p>The Lesser Bosses are, in theory, responsible for many, many other things. Unfortunately, these things go undone or are done sporadically because the Lesser Bosses spend their time doing one thing or another for their bosses.</p>

<h1>Disentangling Management</h1>
 <p>Other than creating an illusion of control, the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> hierarchy is hostile business. It makes innovation nearly impossible and a tremendous amount of money and effort is wasted on the hierarchy and &ldquo;control theater.&rdquo;</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">Radical</span>-hierarchical companies are more efficient because they let go of the illusion of control and let people co-manage themselves. In any case, this and co-ownership is where all businesses are headed. The next stage of evolution is for businesses to transform to co-owned and co-managed companies.</p>

     <p>For a whole society, this is going to be a long process. But each company can do it more quickly by the process of acculturation. Among other things, this helps build trust more quickly.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>This, too, shall pass, but for now, you need <em>capital</em>.</p>
 <p>How else are you going to get your business started? How else are you going to hire the people who are going to build your software? At least, you don&rsquo;t have to pay for office space now, but you still need a budget for socializing spaces (<em>i.e.</em>, because socializing is very important to the team health)</p>
 <p>So, yes, you need capital. But what does that even mean? You need to learn more about it and what it entails.</p>

<h1>The Money Folks</h1>
 <p>You went to a bank but it turned out that they loan money against assets that are worth as much as the loan. They play it safe, but you get the capital in one big lump. Unfortunately, you don&rsquo;t have any safe assets to offer. If you were an established business you&rsquo;d have a revenue stream to offer, but you don&rsquo;t have that, either. So, scratch banks.</p>
 <p>Next on the list is Angels. Essentially, wealthy people who have been through a similar experience and feel some sympathy for you. They can put up some of the money you need and, if you convince enough of them, you can get your new business going.</p>
 <p>Right below them are the VCs, so you talk to a few of them to see if you can skip the Angels altogether. They are very nice, but essentially they tell you that you need “market fit” before  we can make an investment. “We are responsible, y’know, to our Limited Partners. So, you&rsquo;d better off going the Angel route for now.”</p>

<h1>Disentangling Investments</h1>
 <p>Angels trade the money for a “promissory note.” They do promise to either return you capital plus a percentage of it or issue you shares, once the VCs step up to the table.</p>
 <p>Notice that there are no shares and no Board at this point. Some Angels also act like advisors, but that is very different from a Board empowered by capital.</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <img
    src="/assets/img/ins-and-outs-angels.svg"
    alt="A circle with one arrow going in, labeled 'High hopes and enthusiasm' and one arrow going out, labeled 'Promisory note.'"
    width="70%">
  </div>
 <p>VCs are different,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <img
    src="/assets/img/ins-and-outs-vcs.svg"
    alt="A circle with three arrows going in, representing inputs. From top to bottom, 1) 'Market Fit' service or product, 2) High hopes and enthusiasm, and 3) Early clients. The outputs are, from top to bottom, 1) Seed or A-round high risk cash, 2) A pool of (non-voting) shares for early employees, 3) term sheet, and 4) Board of Directors seat for each investor."
    width="70%">
  </div>
 <p>The big difference is that those Board of Director seats give the VCs control of your business (<em>i.e.</em>, really, control of <em>you</em>). And, legal fantasies aside, through you, or your replacement, they have control of the business.

<h1 class='_section'>Disentangling Ownership<h1>

<h1>Businesses & Companies</h1>
 <p>There are various types of ownership. One type of ownership is personal and another type is business ownership. Personal ownership has to do with depreciating assets: houses, cars, and coffee cups. Business ownership has to do with active assets. One or a few people own the profits that come out of the business.</p>
 <p>Whether it is a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or any type of corporation (<em>i.e.</em>, including Cooperatives and B Corps), the profits generated by active assets belong to their owners. Private business are the only option we have today: you either own a business (and its profits) or you are working for a paycheck. We call <em>all of these</em> <a href="#en09"><sup id="bm09">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> businesses, because everything is done by the absolute say so of the owner(s).</p>
 <p>Fiat businesses are hierarchical. They can be generous and progressive, like Patagonia, but, no matter, their overarching goal is to make profits for its owners.</p>

<h1>An Alternative</h1>
 <p>An alternative to the pervasive <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> business model is what we call <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies.<a href="#en10"><sup id="bm10">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <p>Notice that we differentiate &ldquo;businesses&rdquo; from &ldquo;companies.&rdquo; Business, in the sense of manufacturing and trading, is what owners do to create profits for themselves. Company comes from the Latin prefix <em>con-</em> meaning &ldquo;together&rdquo; and the word <em>pan,</em> &ldquo;bread.&rdquo; Company then refers to people who break bread together. So, we talk about  businesses and <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies as two distinct species of the same genus. Like donkeys and zebras.</p>

<h1>Disentangling Ownership</h1>
 <p>Like  businesses, <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies are private. They are not owned by a benevolent-government-in-the-name-of-the-people and they are not cooperatives.</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> companies are owned by what we call co-owners. Instead of it belonging to one or a few people, they are co-owned by everybody who embodies it.</p>
 <p>Instead of a static number of shares, ownership of a <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> company is dynamic. It changes based on contributions recognized by other co-owners.</p>
 <p>Instead of one or a handful of people, you and the other co-owners own the surplus value (<em>i.e.</em>, the profits) that you all create.</p>
