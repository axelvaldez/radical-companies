 <h2>What the Fiat System Does</h2>
  <p>If you are feeling overwhelmed by work, it is not a matter of working harder. That is what your boss tells you, and even your well-meaning co-workers. That is what every business book says, to search for excellence, acquire new habits to move up, and do more with less effort. But it is not you, it is the system that we call <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is designed to create more wealth for the owners and investors of the business you work for.</p>
  <p>The thing is that we created it, and we can create an alternative system, an alternative way of living.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fixing&rdquo; the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system would be never-ending because the system is too easy to game, particularly by powerful people. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system adapts to fixes very fast.</p>
  <p>Beware that alternatives to  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> are fundamentally different and will feel alien, idealistic, and even crazy. It will take more courage than you can imagine.</p>

  <p>If you are not open to this and are just being polite (&ldquo;<em>Sounds interesting, tell me more about it</em>&rdquo;), you are better off returning the book now. Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>

 <h2>What Does Fiat Even Mean?</h2>
  <p>You may not even know what the heck <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> means, but there is something, a feeling you have, that tells you that something is not quite right. And, you are correct in that it is not right, at all. Perhaps you are spending too much time at work. Or you are always ready to travel to a last-minute destination. Or maybe you have to do what would be three days&rsquo; worth of work in two, or one, hoping for an attaboy and maybe a reward. Don't worry, you will get a chance to rest when you get back, but the pile of work is bigger when you get back.</p>
  <p>Maybe you are fully aware of this or maybe you think that this is our destiny. But it is not &ldquo;our destiny.&rdquo; It is not even living. It is the way the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system limits us.</p>
  <p>We want to help make <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> visible, palpable, and how it is causing us the way we feel.</p>

 <h2>Fiat, the Word</h2>
  <p><span class='_quotespan'>But <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> it&rsquo;s a car.</span> And, indeed, FIAT as an acronym is the name of an Italian automobile car manufacturer that stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino</em>. Thus the acronym.</p>
  <p>But what does <em>the word</em> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> mean?</p>
  <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> money, for  example, is worth what each nation says it is (plus or minus what investors will pay for it). Money used to be an equivalent to gold, but that stopped in the 1970s. Now it is because the country says so (and nominally its economy).</p>
  <p>In the context of giving orders, the phrase additionally carries an implied threat: or else. <span class='_quotespan'>Move those boxes from there to over there&hellip;  because I say so&hellip; or else).</span></p>

 <h2>The System</h2>
  <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> environment, or more accurately, a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. Some people do not like the word system associated with their lives, and that is understandable. <span class='_quotespan'>My life is not limited by any system, I shape it however I want to.</span> Maybe &ldquo;ecology&rdquo; is more your thing, but, alas, an ecology is a system, too.</p>
  <p>We created the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system and we uphold it. You have a boss, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. And within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, you work for a wage, but the wealth that you help create goes to the owner of the business you work for, not yourself. These are elements of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system that we created, we live in, and we uphold.</p>
  <p>Worse, the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is based on,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Competition, not collaboration.</li>
    <li>Dividing people, not bringing us together.</li>
    <li>Threats, fear, force, and pain. Not wellbeing.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>Luckily, there are <em>alternatives</em> to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>

 <h2>It Starts with Rules</h2>
  <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to be pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Anybody with an addiction or a tick were at the edge as well.</p>
  <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to a pre-school. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotespan'>did you hit him back harder?</span>) and learn new ones (keep your hands to yourself).</p>
  <p>Lucky that we are, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. <span class='_quotespan'>That will be on the test!</span></p>
  <p>Also, in primary school is when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <img
     src='/assets/img/pic-leo-rayman-grow-and-avoid-green-washing.svg'
     width='70%'
     alt=''>
   </div>
  <p>If we happen to live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simply fiddling with them and learning to make them more comfortable. No matter, we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off. We want to stay away from the people who don't know how to wear their glasses correctly.</p>
  <p>Finally, we go to work, with our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and how to be a good worker. We are happy to be a resource and happier that we are getting a steady wage (until—surprise—we are not).</p>
  <p><span class='_quotespan'>We learn to be kind and condescending to the ones whose glasses are skewed and not fitting correctly. We do our best for these people, but they just don&rsquo;t want to learn the rules. They want to live on the edge.</span></p>

 <h2>Fiat Is&hellip;</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Learning the rules,</li>
    <li>Following the rules,</li>
    <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>Think of what happens when you get caught not following the rules. Think of how many decisions you have made, now think of how you considered in the back of your head what your boss would think of them. Think of how many times you have said, <span class='_quotespan'>I am pretty sure that Bob is not going to like this.</span> You can&rsquo;t make a decision without considering Bob, your boss.</p>
  <p>You may be thinking, <span class='_quotespan'>How else would the system work?</span> Think of decisions and how they have been influenced by what your boss would think of them. It is Bob or chaos. You do what you do, without thinking, because of Bob, your boss. This is encouraged by the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>

</div>


<h1 class='_section'>Countries and Other Divisions</h1>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
  <p>Countries are <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> creations, straight out of kingdoms, cleansed by force.</p>
  <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to conquer the Americas, they waged their own cleansing campaign on their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act Catholic and speak Castilian (or else). The Inquisition stood as a merciless enforcer, ensuring obedience to the rules.</p>
  <p>By the time they got to what would be known as the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Had power over most of the Iberian peninsula and were extracting its wealth accordingly</li>
    <li>Had developed a methodology to cleanse out whatever other cultures they encountered</li>
    <li>They had what it took to subjugate, control, and obliterate anything that stood in their way.</li>
   </ul>

<div class='_h2heading'>

 <h2>Divide and Conquer</h2>
  <p>At some point women were made the property of men and were made subservient to them. That is, for example, why inherited last names are the man&rsquo;s. For exaple, the <span class='_quotespan'>ez</span> at the end of Spanish family names (<em>e.g.</em>, Per<em>ez</em>) is the equivalent to the English possessive (<em>e.g</em>, Pedro&rsquo;s). It indicated that people with that last name &ldquo;belonged to&rdquo; the man called Pedro. Men were the kings of their castle and everybody, including women, were reduced to chattel.</p>
  <p>Sounds comical now, but there is an intuitive logic to it: men, half the population, now had to worry about staying <em>in control</em> of what belonged to them, and not about the injustices from the powerful men above.</p>
  <p>It all was bundled with a strong ideology that created an institution and, surprisingly enough, women became pillars of it. Eve was the instigator of sin, and must submit for salvation. Women covered their hair, wore burkas, and relinquished their autonomy in the name of duty and survival.</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <div class='_citation'>
     <p>The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don't turn against him, they crush those beneath them.</p>
     <p id='_signature'>Emily Bront&euml;</p>
    </div>
   </div>
  <p>As Christianity spread by force of colonization, non-Europeans were made subservient to Europeans. Of course, there were wealthy non-Europeans, close to their colonial masters, and poor non-Europeans. The wealthier were even put in charge.</p>
  <p>We are still struggling with that attitude today, thousands of years later. We could be in paradise, but the woman enticed us to bite the apple of knowledge and poisoned us. We are still struggling with the leftovers of colonization, domestic and foreign. We are on our way to bring it all out in the open and heal the wounds, but it is a struggle as powerful people cling to the past.</p>

 <h2>Lording</h2>
  <p>With men lording over half of the population, it was easier for a few men to lord over them. And they did. They could appeal to the stories and imagined history to support this convenient ideology that happened to support the making of kingdoms and empires.</p>
  <p>The Jewish tradition, Christianity, and Islam have an eternal, almighty, all powerful boss at the top. You would not dare to even think of yourself as equal to such power, you can only submit to it.</p>

</div>

<h1>Radical</h1>
  <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to conquer the Americas, they waged their own cleansing campaign on their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act Catholic and speak Castilian (or else). The Inquisition stood as a merciless enforcer, ensuring obedience to the Church.</p>
  <p>By the time they got to the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla had developed a methodology to cleanse whatever other cultures they encountered—a tool to subjugate, control, and obliterate anything that stood in their way,</p>
  <p>In a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, there is no imposed hierarchy or divisions. If you believe in a supernatural world and supernatural beings, so be it, but the story of the omnipotent boss at the top doesn’t work for people anymore; in fact, that particular belief works against our survival as a species.</p>
  <p>The alternative is <em>not chaos</em>, but it is certainly different.</p>

<div class='_h2heading'>

 <h2>Community</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>I trust my decentralized and fully transparent community.</li>
    <li>What is going to keep my community growing is what’s good for us.</li>
    <li>People in my community listen to me. They help make my ideas easier to understand. They help me find meaning.</li>
    <li>And if that is not the case, I leave.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>Foundation</h2 >
  <p>This is the Foundation of a community,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A community must help me find Meaning. This is a community that I want to Belong to.</li>
    <li>To work for every member, the community must be fully decentralized and transparent.</li>
    <li>Members are free to experiment. Not meeting the expected result, means that we learn how not to do it.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>Alignment</h2>
  <p>But the Foundation is not enough, it needs an Explicit Alignment,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>To hold us together a community must define the <em>what for</em>, the Impact it wants to have on the world.</li>
    <li>It must be explicit about the <em>why</em>, its Purpose that made it come together as a community.</li>
    <li>The community can then define the <em>what, when,</em> and <em>how</em>, of each Mission of the work it needs to do.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>It is explicit in that it lays it all out for all to know; there are no dark corners where need-to-know information is kept away from view.</p>
  <p>It is alignment in the sense that it ties people together into a community with something in common.</p>
  <p>To be clear,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>If the <em>what for</em>, the Impact, is not your thing, then you don’t join the community. In theory it could be changed, but in practice it would make it a different community. It would be like transforming a hardware company into a software company. Sun Microsystems failed to continue as an independent business because it is very, very difficult.</li>
    <li>If the why, the Purpose, doesn’t work for you it is somewhat easier to change. Not a walk in the park, but easier to change. And if that doesn’t work, you don’t join the community.</li>
    <li>The what, when, and how, the Mission, changes all the time. People may be pursuing different Missions in parallel and you may join one of them. Or you may create your own with the support of the community.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>No Divisions</h2>
  <p>All members are co-owners of the result of the community’s work. If their goal is to build products or services it would be called a <em>company</em>,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>We are used to having businesses around. Their one and only goal is to create wealth for the owner. It may start with different ideals, but in the end it has got to make wealth for the owner. You get paid whatever the boss feels is reasonable.</li>
    <li>A company is a group of people that comes together as a community to improve the wellbeing of their members. We call these members co-owners. They own everything about the company, including its revenue. The level of co-ownership is not <em>equal</em>, as in co-ops, but it is equitable based on contributions.</li>
    <li>BTW, the word company comes from the Latin prefix <span class='_quotespan''>co-,<span> meaning <em>together</em>, and the Latin word <span class='_quotespan''>-pan,</span> meaning <em>bread.</em> <span class='_quotespan'>Breaking bread together</span>.</li>
    <li>The level of co-ownership is determined by contributions, not capital.</li>
    <li>These contributions are recognized by other co-owners.</li>
   </ul>

</div>

<h1>And&hellip;</h1>
 <p>And, yes, there is an app for that.</p>


<h1 class='_section'>Capital vs Contributions</h1>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
  <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world we live in, the default is that the only way to contribute to a business is to invest capital in it. Said capital investment gives the investors power over the business. In the US investors don’t technically have any power over company operations. But there is a big, juicy loophole: they can replace the CEO. And they can keep replacing him until they find one that runs the operations according to their wishes. This only one of the side-effects of seeing capital as the only way to contribute.</p>
  <p>For one, power is force. So given their capital contribution, investors have power over the business. On the other hand, you have no ownership in the business and you are happy to get your salary, but that’s that. Owners have power over you.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
  <p>This is probably the most shocking thing about <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> alternatives: companies are not there to make founders and investors wealthy. Companies have to make money and be self-sustainable. But what usually goes into the pocket of the owners, now goes into the pockets of the co-owners, into the pockets of everybody who contributes to creating the wealth. If you are looking for yet another way to become wealthy, this ain&rsquo;t it. Companies are a way to increase the wellbeing of every co-owner and the society around them.</p>
  <p>Your level of co-ownership is determined by these contributions given to you by your co-owner peers. Your recognized contributions determine your level of co-ownership on a month to month basis. It is not static, it is dynamic. Next month it will most likely be different.</p>

<div class='_h2heading'>

 <h2>The Calculations</h2>
  <p>RADs make contributions tangible.</p>
  <p>You get a <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span> every day to give, not to keep. RADs are distributed based on what you recognize as contributions,</p>
  <p>As you give those RADs away, you are giving other people ownership in the company. No boss needed.</p>
  <p>The mobile app does all the calculations.</p>

 <h2>But&hellip;</h2>
  <p>At this point you may be coming up with objections, <span class='_quotespan'>Yeah, but it can be easily gamed: I&rsquo;ll give you all my <span class='_paradigm'>RADs</span> and you give me all of yours.</span></p>
  <p>And yes, it could, but only if the other co-owners do not say anything. Because of Transparency, they can see all the transactions and it is up to the co-owners to say or do something. They can have a conversation with people who seem to be trying to game the process. If they do not change their behavior, co-owners can decide to not recognize any of their contributions because they are doing something that makes co-ownership a joke.</p>
  <p>Another objection might be that people won&rsquo;t want to take the time to recognize contributions. They may do it at first, but then they will stop. Again, the data is there for all to see and if all co-owners stop recognizing contributions, then they won&rsquo;t get any more co-ownership, including the take of the revenue. They may slow down until they see the result and then, I hope, they will go back to doing it. If not, the company will fall apart. On the way to a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> alternative things won&rsquo;t go perfect or smoothly. There will be plenty of bumps along the way. The &ldquo;fix,&rdquo; in my opinion, is not to elect a boss to tell us what to do; the &ldquo;fix&rdquo; is to deal with what you consider a problem—you are all co-owners.</p>
  <p>An objection that I heard more than once is that <em>other</em> people are coin operated. They do not want to do anything for a community or society. &ldquo;Homo economicus&rdquo; is one of those convenient stories that popped up to support the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. People are not coin operated, but people have to survive and will go to kinds of lengths to do it. The thing to observe is that survival, though necessary, is not living.</p>

 <h2>Capital</h2>
  <p>Capital does have a place in a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> company, but it doesn&rsquo;t acquire power. A <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> Investment is more like an investment in that it carries the risk of non-payment and it is a loan in that the return is negotiated.</p>
  <p>Usually that capital goes to pay for,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Things needed by the company.</li>
    <li>To fund a Predictable Recurring Income (PRI) fund.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>The PRI</h2>
  <p>The PRI is used to pay co-owners a predictable, recurring income (like a salary) when there is little or no revenue. The PRI is paid back by the revenue each co-owner gets given their RADs. Until it is paid in full, what a co-owner takes out of the PRI fund is a personal debt. Once the PRI fund is paid, the upside (dividends) that would normally go to the owners and investors goes to the co-owners according to their RADs.</p>

 <h2>But&hellip;</h2>
  <p><span class='_quotespan'>But what about investing in the future? Owners don&rsquo;t put all the profits in their pocket, they invest it!</span></p>
  <p>Indeed many do, and co-owners can do the same. I make a distinction between profits and dividends, and the latter is what is left after paying all expenses, <em>including any investments</em>. For example, if the co-owners want to buy a $5M building, they would put up a <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> to accumulate that amount. They could decide to commit enough into the <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> to build up to $5M in three years. That amount is not to be included in the dividends.</p>

 <h2>Banners</h2>
  <p>Banners represent non-people things like projects and investments. With the RADs! mobile app you can, at minimum, create a <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span>, change your contribution to it, see who is contributing, and the beneficiaries.</p>
  <p>For the case where all co-owners agree, the <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> could look like this,</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <table style='width:80%; border:1px dotted #808080; '>
     <tr>
      <th style='background-color:yellow; text-align:left; width:50%; '><span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span>:</th>
      <th style='background-color:#22FFFF; text-align:left; width:50%; '>Contributions:</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td style='background-color:yellow; width:25rem; '>

      <td style='background-color:#22FFFF; width:25rem; '>All: $100.00</td>
     </tr>
    </table>
   </div>
  <p>Alternatively, all co-owners may not agree to commit any particular amount. In that case, the <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> would be funded by a subset of co-owners and when the building is bought the monthly rent would go to them according to their investment.</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <table style='width:80%; border:1px dotted #808080; '>
     <tr>
      <th style='background-color:yellow; text-align:left; width:50%; '><span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span>:</th>

<h1 class='_section'>Rules, Laws, and Force</h1>
 <p>Imagine a world where rules, initially upheld through conventions, eventually morph into cold, heartless <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> laws that leave us no choice but to comply. <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is a relentless force, bearing down on us with an iron grip.</p>

<div class='_h2heading'>

 <h2>Force</h2>
  <p>Picture this,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You get a traffic ticket. A very minor form of force.</li>
    <li>You have to give up money (<em>i.e.</em>, coined force) to be spared the pain that would follow if you don&rsquo;t.</li>
    <li>If you strongly feel that is an injustice, you let it go to court (<em>i.e.</em>, another type of force).</li>
    <li>Either you win or you lose,
     <ul>
      <li>Victory brings celebration, the force is with you.</li>
      <li>If you are defeated, you are angry, but you have to pay the ticket. Still a minor force.</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>On the other hand, if you happen to be from the edge, any sort of protest or disobedience may send you to prison. This is no longer a minor force.</li>
    <li>Behind those cold, unforgiving walls a fight may break out and blood is spilled and lives are maimed or lost. Either way, it is definitely a <em>force majeure.</em></li>
   </ul>
  <p>Force is ever present in our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. It goes from merely a frown to the ghastly specter of the electric chair.</p>
  <p>Withholding a reward because you did not say or did what was expected of you is a form of force. Getting passed over for a raise or promotion is a form of force. Firing you or laying you off is a form of force. Raising your rent so your only option is to leave is a form of force. We are surrounded by a system that runs on force, from threats to actual pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Motivation&rdquo; is another form of force. Do this and you&rsquo;ll get the reward. We often fail to see it for what it truly is—an external force, driving us toward someone else's desires. But you are being &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; to do what somebody else wants, regardless of what you may want to do. That is force.</p>
  <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>-base alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system there is no do-it-or-else force. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> myth is that without force we would never do anything of significance, we would never do anything bigger than ourselves. They try to shatter our belief in our own capabilities, in our power of our collective potential.</p>
  <p>But I ask you to consider this: humanity evolved and has survived and thrived as a species for a long time. We birthed agriculture, spreading its roots across every corner of the planet. We managed to do all that and more without anybody dictating our path, without anyone wielding force to mold us.</p>
  <p>Then came the people who took things by force, because they had nothing to trade. And then came money, coinage which allowed them to trade the wealth that they extracted from you by force. And slowly by surely the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system took shape around us.</p>
  <p>Alongside, there came the stories that supported the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system as it evolved,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>An all powerful supernatural being at the top</li>
    <li>Paradise</li>
    <li>Eve as the bad apple</li>
    <li>Homosexuals as abominations, pushed to the edge.</li>
    <li><span class='_quotespan'>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ,</span> from the Judeo-Christian Old Testament</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>Insidious</h2>
  <p>Most insidious of all, we learn to expect that the fruit of our work should go to someone else,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A god, an omnipotent being at the top</li>
    <li>A boss, an omnipotent being at the top.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>And that we get paid what the boss says is reasonable.</p>
  <p>It didn&rsquo;t start this way, but it evolved. First came prisoners of minor wars that were made to carry whatever the winners didn&rsquo;t want to carry, including the winners dead. At the end they either joined the winners (after all, they were related) or they went back to their village. Then came slavery, they kept you as a worthless worker because they had the force (and you were not related). Finally came wage work. From forced labor by sheer force to forced labor by coin. Different forms of force, but force throughout.</p>
  <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> tendrils extend deep into every aspect of our lives, particularly in the realms of economics and politics. For example, &ldquo;being a good worker&rdquo; is a sign of pride today within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system you and I live in. Unwavering loyalty to their chosen politicians, no matter the cost. There is nothing strange about it, it is totally normal. The alternative, they say, is chaos to be avoided at all costs.</p>
  <p>Anybody talking about alternatives (you and I) must be crazy. Ignore them.</p>
  <p>Organized religion has been part of the support system as well, but before we talk about that, we have to talk about divide-and-conquer.</p>

<h1 class='_section'>From Democracies to Dictatorships</h1>
 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model and its embedded force is at the root of all governance, from democracies to dictatorships. Can you think of a decentralized national government? I can&rsquo;t, either, because it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>I have already said a lot about <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. One thing I mentioned in passing is that <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> evolved into the complex mess it is today. For example, the Christian Bible admonished slaves to &ldquo;obey your earthly masters.&rdquo; However, when outright slavery went out the door, that stopped being acceptable language (though the majority of women and children to this day still have to obey their earthly masters).</p>
  <p>The thing that has remained constant in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is Force.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>As opposed to <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>, <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> is a Foundation of what we need at the root of the system (<em>i.e.</em>, in yellow, below), not a system that has evolved to be a big, hairy ball of hair. <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> does not have embedded rules and it is not dogmatic in any way,</p>
  <div class='_center'>

  </div>
 <p> When looking for solutions to what we feel is wrong, we often get lost in the intellectual weeds and point to the first obvious thing. We never get beyond this point and we end up never discovering what&rsquo;s really at the root of the problem. The <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> Foundation helps us remain clear,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Will this decision make us more or less decentralized? Either choice is up to you and your community, but the Foundation helps you know which direction the decision is  taking you.</li>
   <li>Will this decision make it easier to help people find meaning in what they are doing or not? Again, either choice is up to you and your community, but the Foundation helps you know where you are headed.</li>
    <p>You may be leaning one way, but rethink it once you realize where it would take you. What you definitely will not be able to do is hide behind, <span class='_quotespan'>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know!</span></p>
    <p><span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> doesn&rsquo;t come with rules out of the box, but you and the community of people you work with can come up with any rules you want; without Force. You are all co-owners  and none of you have the right to Force to others.</p>
  </ul>


<h1 class='_section'>Competition and Collaboration</h1>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>Competition is another constant feature of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model. We learn to compete from the minute we are born. Kindergarten slows it down a little, but it comes back in full force in everything that follows. We pretend to listen, but we are really waiting for our chance to outcompete the previous speakers. Sometimes we are aggressive and sometimes we are meek, but underneath it all we compete in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. There are even debate clubs where we can practice our competitive skills.</p>
 <p>And, &ldquo;so?&rdquo; you ask, &ldquo;<em>what is wrong with that? We need to compete to survive</em>.&rdquo; But I see it as a way to divide people, as in divide and conquer. Them who win and they who lose. This makes it a lot easier for the powerful to just pay off enough of the winners.</p>
 <p>Democracy-by-voting probably was the best system in the 18th century, but here we are, 300 hundred years later in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Things have changed and we can do better now.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>Competition is a way of imposing your will. Cooperation is how you negotiate your will. Collaboration is the way to come up with acceptable goals. The people who can&rsquo;t live with these goals, have to come up with their own proposal. BTW, this is called <em>consent</em> by Sociocracy practitioners and as far as I know, they came up with it.</p>
 <p>We don&rsquo;t need to compete to survive. We need to compete to survive within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system where artificial, made up scarcity is used as a tool of force. This is what Marx never figured out. He just wanted a system where the workers were at the top and powerful at the bottom. Stalin named himself the representative of all workers and the rest is history: worker at the top and everybody else at the bottom.</p>


<h1 class='_section'>Scarcity and Abundance<h1>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>Food scarcity ended centuries ago, as soon as agriculture started to mix in with hunting and gathering. But then, agriculture brought in land scarcity. At least, that&rsquo;s how the story goes.</p>
 <p>Actually, what agriculture brought about was land enclosures. An enclosure is when somebody takes, by force, over land that was previously communal and provided for all. After the enclosure, if you want to use the land, you have to render goods.</p>
 <p>Abundance for a few, scarcity for everybody else.</p>
 <p>In the Fiat system, abundance creates scarcity. Abundance brings out the forces to enclose and creates scarcity for the rest of us. For example, the newest abundant good is the so-called AI computing. It is abundant because it evolved in the Open Source space (free, as in beer), but some people would like to <em>enclose</em> that technology with regulation (force). People like Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX, Sam Altman, OpenAI, Kent Walker, SVP at Google, Mustafa Suleyman, Co-founder of DeepMind, Francesca Rossi, Global Leader at IBM Research are lobbying the US Congress for regulation that would amount to enclosure.</p>
 <p>Abundance for a few, scarcity for everybody else, 21<sup>st</sup> century style.</p>

<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>Enclosures do come out of Force and Force is a no-no in <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based alternatives.</p>
 <p>We can&rsquo;t fix history, but we can choose our future. And we can choose a future where abundance is the rule, not the exception-until-somebody-figures-out-how-to-exploit-it.</p>
 <p>We must lead the way to such a future. It won&rsquo;t be easy and there will be many obstacles in the way. Many will come from inside us, children-of-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> that we are. Nevertheless, we need to make it happen.</p>


<h1 class='_section'>Pain vs Wellbeing</h1>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model is based on Pain and people have gotten used to avoiding pain and surviving.</p>
 <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system a Threat is usually enough to get compliance. If not, Force and Pain will rear their ugly heads.</p>

  <p>Ironically, managers can be the happiest abandoning their titles and becoming co-owners with their former employees.

  <p>First, I jumped into the void, past my fears. I was hoping to go through it safely. Instead I came out stronger, with a positive view of life. It was a blind jump, but I discovered the light in my life.</p>
  <p>I am not split between my &ldquo;personal&rdquo; live and my "work" life. I am one and the same no matter what I am doing.</p>
  <p>I was surviving, not living. But now I can recognize the fears that held me in survival mode. I can go around them, lovingly, and go on with my life, guiding me, not my fears. I am still afraid, but I am living my life. The more I do it, the easier it gets. I am not afraid of dying, so I am not afraid of living.</p>

<h1 class='_section'>RADs<h1>

<h1>Fiat</h1>
 <p>In a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> business, things are static. &ldquo;<em>You give me so much cash, and I&rsquo;ll give you a percentage of the company</em>.&rdquo; That percentage of the business  remains fixed forever. You can even die and your heirs inherit that piece of the business. They will try to dilute you, but if you stay on your tippy toes, you can fight it.</p>
 
<h1>Radical</h1>
 <p>In a company based on <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>, things are dynamic. You give me so much cash, negotiate a return, and you get your principal and the negotiated return in a negotiated timeframe. You contribute a lot this month and you end up with a serious percentage of all RADs and you get a serious percentage of the dividends. Next month you don&rsquo;t contribute as much and you end up with a smaller percentage of RADs and a smaller percentage of dividends. Ownership is dynamic.</p>

<h1>What Are RADs?</h1>
 <p>RADs are like tokens—not crypto tokens or anything like them. Your RADs really are a percentage of all RADs ever given. That is your percentage of whatever is distributed through them. Most often it is dividends. That is what remains of the revenue after paying all expenses, taxes, and any investments. This usually goes to the owners, but in <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> companies it goes to people who create the wealth, people like you, the co-owners.</p>
 <p>The number of RADs you get for a given cycle (<em>e.g.</em>, one month) is calculated from the number of Recognized Contributions. These are your contributions that your peer co-owners have recognized as significant. They accumulate and at the end of the month the <em>RADs! Mobile App</em> calculates the number of RADs that each co-owner gets. They may be guidelines that your community has agreed to, but in the end it is whatever moves you to press the recognition button.</p>
  <div class='_center'>

    width='70%'
    alt=''>
   </div>
 <p>The reason I think that the RADs! Mobile App is fundamental is because it is likely the sharp end of the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> spear,</p>

<div class='_h2heading'>

<h1>People Need to Learn How to Be Owners</h1>
 <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world we live in, we are trained to look for a job. Preferably, a high status, high paying job. When we talk about being an owner&hellip; well, we don&rsquo;t talk about that. &ldquo;<em>Some people do that, but it is a lot of work and why would you want to work that hard for a bare living?</em>&rdquo; And if the business fails to make you &ldquo;<em>a bare living</em>,&rdquo; that mark&rsquo;s on you forever. &ldquo;<em>Get a good job instead. I hear the Post Office is hiring!</em>&rdquo;</p>
 <p>People need to learn to be owners and all the fear that it brings up. They have to learn to recognize others&rsquo; contributions without being afraid of &ldquo;making them look good.&rdquo; People need to learn to collaborate, and get away from competing all the time. They have to be able to let others know what they are doing and why you think it is important to all co-owners, it ain&rsquo;t bragging if you&rsquo;ve done it. It is not a matter of learning to sell or any such, it is a matter of learning to be an owner.</p>

<h1>People Need to Learn to Notice and Recognize Contributions</h1>
 <p>Recognizing contributions is not as simple as it sounds. The usual &ldquo;contribution&rdquo; is work-related. The number of code check ins or the number of bags of concrete you brought in from the truck. All work-related. But talking to somebody who is down and lifting up her spirits is a major contribution.</p>
  <div class='_citation'>
   <p>R, the cleaning woman, went by picking up the stuff people had left behind on their desks the day before. There were only a handful of people in the office at the time, including a young woman who looked really down.</p>
   <p>When R came back around she started talking to the young woman. It was easy to listen in, so I did.</p>
   <p>It turned out that the young woman had a traumatic experience the night before. She had not slept much and decided to come to the office early instead of facing her walls. But here she was, facing the office walls. The conversation continued and went on for a while, but by the end the young woman said <span class='_quotespan'>Screw him. His loss.</span></p>
   <p>Now she was looking more like her usual self.</p>
  </div>
 <p>That was a major contribution,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>R noticed that somebody was not her usual self, and</li>
   <li>R engaged her in conversations.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>It was definitely a <em>major contribution</em> to the young woman and our community. If we had the <em>RADs! Mobile App</em> back then, I would have pressed the recognition button many times. Or perhaps not. That is why practice is necessary.</p>
 <p>If I were in the grip of my <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> cage I might have thought, &ldquo;<em>that was fantastic, but no, it doesn&rsquo;t equate to the amount of code I checked in yesterday</em>.&rdquo; In order to recognize all forms of contributions, we have to train ourselves out of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> cage and the <em>RADs! Mobile App</em> is the equipment for it.</p>

<h1>People Need to Learn to Give Pieces of the Company to Their Peers</h1>
      <td>
       <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world we live in, getting ownership in a business is a big, big deal. Many meetings happen, voices and tempers rise, and finally an agreement is cast in stone. After much grumbling the investor hands over cash and in exchange the business owner signs a stock certificate and gives it to the investor.</p>
       <p>In a company based on the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> foundation, everybody, every co-owner, gives away pieces of the company as they see fit. But this is a skill like any other, and we will have to learn it. We are the pioneers.  We, the children of <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>, have to learn to be leaders of <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-base alternatives.</p>

<h1><em>The RAD! Mobile App</em></h1>
  <p>The <em>RADs! Mobile App</em> is deceptively simple to use, but it might just change the world by giving people a chance to live an alternative.</p>


<h1 class='_section'>Co-Ownership</h1>
 <p>As opposed to centralized <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> ownership, which is what we live with now, co-ownership is profoundly transformative. It evokes hope and possibility. This revolutionary concept marks the demise of oligarchic wealth and decentralized power. Gone are the days of toiling for a mere wage; instead, you will be rewarded based on the contributions you make as recognized by your peer. No longer will a traditional  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> owner hoard the wealth generated by your efforts. Instead, you will reap the wealth you helped create, enjoying an empowering and fulfilling experience.</p>
 <p>Co-ownership is the least understood thing about the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> paradigm. It is not a co-op and it is not revenue sharing. It is powerfully different. We&rsquo;ll get into the details of it below.</p>

<h1>RADs Instead of Shares</h1>
 <p>Before I go on, I need to explain what <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are.</p>
 <p>The name, RADs, is meaningless. It is the first name I could think of. But they are the key to decentralized ownership.</p>
 <p>We are used to ”somebody else,” the boss, owning the business. <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s make it possible to have decentralized ownership, where you and your peers own the company. You are part of creating value and wealth, and with <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you are a co-owner of it.</p>
 <p>The value that you help create shows up as revenue, money paid for your goods or services. With decentralized ownership, you are a co-owner of that revenue. Now &ldquo;somebody else&rdquo; owns it.</p>

<h1>Not Revenue Sharing</h1>
 <p>Revenue sharing is done according to what the boss says people are going to get. In the  <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based model, the system is decentralized and there is no boss to decide what you are going to get. Instead, your peers decide how many <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you get and you decide how many they get.</p>
 <p>The percentage of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you end up with determines what percentage of the revenue you get.</p>

<h1>Not a Co-op</h1>
 <p>Co-operatives make everybody financially equal. But people&rsquo;s contributions are not equal. The same person can contribute a lot one month, but less the next.</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are used to keep a tally of contributions.</p>

<h1>How RADs Work</h1>
 <p>Now we can talk about how RADs work.</p>
 <p>The whole thing starts with recognized contributions. As you do your work, other co-owners will recognize some of it as contributions that resonate with them and they will record those using the <em>RADs! mobile app</em> by simply pressing a button. The more significant you find the contribution, the more button presses.</p>
 <p>At the end of the cycle (<em>e.g.</em>, a week, a month), the app calculates how many <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s those recognized contributions translate to. That many RADs are given to each of the contributing co-owners.</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s accumulate, so each cycle adds to existing RADs.</p>

<h1>Shares Tired, RADs Wired</h1>
 <p>As I mentioned,  <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based companies don&rsquo;t have shares. Ownership is based on recognized contributions, not capital</p>
 <p>Shares are a 16<sup>th</sup> century invention that worked pretty much as <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s, with one significant difference: shares are based on capital while RA<span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>sDs are based on recognized contributions. But they are both ways to create something bigger than one person could.</p>
 <p>Business shares must have sounded crazy, like <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s sound today. The clientele for shares back then already were risk takers and it was a smaller audience. The audience for RADs is everybody who has been trained since birth to work for a wage and leave everything else to the oligarchic owners. We are counting on them being more educated and who sense that the current system is not working for them.</p>

<h1>Decentralized Ownership</h1>
 <p>Decentralized ownership is sustainable. The company is not dependent on a top boss. It is forever flexible.</p>
 <p>Decentralized ownership lasts&hellip; forever. For one, there is no issue of inheritance.</p>

<h1>Co-ownership is dynamic</h1>
 <p>Say in January you make a lot of contributions that are recognized by your peers. Your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s go up quite a bit. But in February you are down to routine things. You get a few recognized contributions, but not many. Your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s go up a bit, but not much.</p>
 <p>In March you and your team give talks about the projects you just finished and how it is going to reduce costs significantly. Your recognized contributions go up and so do your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s. Then you go on vacation in April. Your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s stay the same but the total <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s go up (<em>e.g.</em>, more people) so your percentage of revenue goes down.</p>
 <p>Your level of revenue ownership bobs up and down depending on 1) the contributions you make, and 2) how many of those are recognized by your peers.</p>
 <p>The same is going on for every co-owner and their level of revenue ownership changes.</p>

<h1>No Get-Rich-Quick Scheme</h1>
 <p>In our  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world, owning a business is the way to accumulate a lot of money. You pay yourself well and keep the dividends. If you are lucky, somebody buys your company and you make a big lump sum. In the  <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based approach, this is not it.</p>
 <p>You accumulate  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> money by keeping the wealth that other people created. Yes, you pay them good wages to do so, but you keep the bulk of the value they create. In the  <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based space you get paid according to the contributions that your peer co-owners recognize. Because you are getting a portion of what a  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> owner keeps, you have the potential of making much more than a mere wage.</p>

<h1>Capital</h1>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>But, I need capital. That is the normal way to get started!</span></p>
 <p>Capital still has a role to play, but it just doesn&rsquo;t get power over the company.</p>
  <div class='_center'>

   </div>
  </div>
 <p>A  <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> Investment is more like a loan, but with negotiated returns. More below.</p>
 <p>The point being that mere capital doesn’t get of the powers that investors get in the  <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world.</p>

<h1>What’s the Catch?</h1>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>Sounds like people are not guaranteed a salary!</span></p>
 <p>And, yes, people are not guaranteed a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> salary. However, if you choose, the <span class='_paradigm'>PRI Fund</span> can provide a <em>Predictable, Recurring Income.</em> You are not expected to get paid less than in a Fiat business. However, you are not a replaceable resource in a machine that makes wealth for others, <em>you are a co-owner.</em> You have to learn to do different,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You are expected to speak up if you think another co-owner is trying to game the system.</li>
   <li>You are expected to  for what goes on with the company..</li>
   <li>You are expected to talk to your peer co-owners so they understand what you are working on and how it will benefit them and the community.</li>
   <li>You are expected to speak up when you see opportunities that others may not see.</li>
   <li>You can help people to migrate out of violent language and into language that helps to learn and grow.</li>
   <li>To do all that and more because it is <em>your</em> company.</li>
  </ul>
 <p style='font-size:larger; '>That is the catch!</p>
