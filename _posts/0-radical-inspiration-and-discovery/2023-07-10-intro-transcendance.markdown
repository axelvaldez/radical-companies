 <p>Intro to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat System</span> and to the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical Foundation.</span>.</p>

<h1>Who Am I If Not a Manager?</h1>
 <div class='_citation'>
  <p>When we talk to people about going <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> at their company, many perceive an existential threat to managers. <span class='_quotespan'>If you are getting rid of my job type, then you are getting rid of me.</span></p>
  <p>Ironically, managers can be the happiest abandoning their titles and becoming co-owners with their former employees. People who are today "managers" will benefit the most by going <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> because they are currently boxed up by the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> hierarchy.</p>

<h1>How <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> Developed (according to me)</h1>
 <p>By the time Thomas Hobbes writes Leviathan the idea that people were a  warring species was already normalized. Hobbes argued that humanity&rsquo;s natural state was a &ldquo;war of all against all.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Surviving Is Not Living</h1>
 <div class='_citation'>
  <p>First, I jumped into the void, past my fears. I was hoping to go through it safely. Instead I came out stronger, with a positive view of life. It was a blind jump, but I discovered the light in my life.</p>
  <p>I am not split between my &ldquo;personal&rdquo; live and my "work" life. I am one and the same no matter what I am doing.</p>
  <p>I was surviving, not living. But now I can recognize the fears that held me in survival mode. I can go around them, lovingly, and go on with my life, guiding me, not my fears. I am still afraid, but I am living my life. The more I do it, the easier it gets. I am not afraid of dying, so I am not afraid of living.</p>
  <p>Nobody knows how to live my life better than myself. Nobody, besides me, knows what's best for me.</p>
