<div style="display:none;">
  <p>Every time I talk about <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> and the co-ownership model a question always comes up that surprises me.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>The questions were about hiring. I tried to explain that my preference is that there&rsquo;d be no hiring, per se. The <span class="_paradigm">Radical</span> system is set up for that. But to no avail,</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <table class='_h2table'>
    <tr>
     <th>
      <p>What do you do if you can&rsquo;t offer as much as the competition?</p>
     </th>
     <td>
      <p>You don&rsquo;t have competition. You must be doing something different or else you should create an ensemble with &ldquo;the competition&rdquo; if you are working towards the exact same impact.</p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>
      <p>You&rsquo;ll make money based on your contributions, that won&rsquo;t change. And you&rsquo;ll work faster.</p>
     </th> 
     <td>
      <p>Absolute win, which is what you are describing, is what we know and it is <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> thinking: I win it all, you lose it all. However, it is not the way to have a broad impact in a world based on contributions.</p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>
      <p>What if they steal my ideas?</p>
     </th>
     <td>
      <p>Nobody can steal other people&rsquo;s ideas. Somebody else cannot copy you. They take away the stuff that resonated with them, but that is it.</p>
      <p>Back to the &ldquo;offer more money&rdquo; competition&hellip; let&rsquo;s say that these other people are completely <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span>. All they know is that money works and they offered your candidate more than you. Time and time again, they &ldquo;win.&rdquo; It seems to me that those people that went for &ldquo;more money&rdquo; would not be aligned with you community. Keep looking until a candidate shows enough interest and curiosity; that is the candidate you want. One who wants to learn.</p>

     <th>
      <p>But what if she doesn&rsquo;t have the skills I need?</p>
     </th>  
     <td>
      <p>To make sure&hellip; this is a person who knows how to program, right? But she doesn&rsquo;t know the specific language your team needs, is that it?</p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>
      <p>Exactly!</p>
     </th>
     <td>
      <p>And you don&rsquo;t think that she can learn a new language?</p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>
      <p>Well, yes, she can learn. But I need her to know that specific language the minute she walks in the door.</p>
     </th>
     <td>
      <p>That sounds like bad planning on your part, right?&hellip;</p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>
      <p>Of course not, but&hellip;</p>
     </th>
     <td>
     <p>&hellip; then why not give her a chance to learn the new language. That is going to go a lot faster than learning co-management and co-ownership. Also, your team should explain what they need and she may even know somebody who can mentor her or she can propose another language that would be better suited to their needs.</p>
