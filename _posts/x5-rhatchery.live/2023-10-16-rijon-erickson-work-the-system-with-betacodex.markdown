<h1>Musician</h1>
 <p>Rijon is a musician. Rijon plays BetaCodex.</p>

<h1>Co-Owned</h1>
 <p>We really enjoyed this podcast.</p>
 <p>Rijon is very enthusiastic. He co-owned the conversation, and really got into it. He is very much aligned with the Radical Foundation-based model and kinda spoke the language.</p>
 <p>He assumed that there has to be bosses, but that is a universal view. Nevertheless, he bemoaned that &ldquo;fact of life.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Bosses?</h1>
 <p>BTW, when you ask “<em>why?</em>” it is not so ‘obvious’ that there has to be ranked bosses, with the titles and all that. (see our second book, <em>Radical in Detail</em>).</p>
