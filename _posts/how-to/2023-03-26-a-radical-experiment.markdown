 <p>An experiment starts with a hypothesis, our expectations for it. It could be negated, or give a basis for a story if the experiment gives the predicted results. In any case, it helps dissipate the tension, for a while.</p>

<h1>The Hypothesis</h1>
 <p>Your hypothesis is in tension with something, perhaps with an ideology, or with religious beliefs, or with &ldquo;known&rdquo; facts. Whatever it is, the experiment is not for corroborating your hypothesis, but for negating your assumptions. If the experiment gives the predicted result, it helps dissipate the tension. It becomes part of a new story that <span class="_quotespan">everybody knows.</span></p>
 <p>A while later, other people with come up with a different hypothesis and off goes your stories and your assumptions and what <span class="_quotespan">everybody knows.</span></p>

<h1>Example: Gravity and Relativity</h1>
 <p>The canonical example of this is Einstein&rsquo;s relativity and Newton&rsquo;s gravity. <em>A ot of people knew</em> that anything with mass will also have gravity and that gravity acted in a certain way. Then came Eisntein with the implication that gravity was more complex than Newton assumed and definitely acted differectly at the very micro and very macro levels.</p>

<h1>Example: Belt Levels</h1>
 <p>This example came up last Friday. The question came up as, <span class="_quotespan">Is X be compatible with the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> system?</span> My first answer was a very <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <em>No!</em> It took a while (<em>i.e.</em>, this <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> stuff is not easy to shake), but I think I eventually came up with a truly <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>, out-of-love response: <span class="_quotespan">run an experiment!</span></p>
 <p>
  In this case, X refered to a mentoring system based on the Karate Belt level system. The problem with these schemes is that can get <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>-complicated quickly, <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; and pay would be based on that</span>.
 </p>

<h1>The Analysis</h1>
 <p>There were two things involved: 1) the Belt level ranking and 2) money. The way I looked at it, a ranking of any sort is a no-go unless it is based on something. <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s work because they are based on &ldquo;contributions.&rdquo; So, the experiment should deal with figuring that out.</p>
 <p>Jose pointed out that they should be on the look out for not introducing force. <span class="_quotespan">A test represents force.</span> I would say that having a committee decide also injects force as well.</p>

<h1>Money and Rank</h1>
 <p>Salaries are pretty integral to the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system. Employees earn a wage, owners reap profits.</p>
 <p>Eventually, co-owners will, I hope, switch to PRI to distribute <em>earned dividends</em>.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> At that point earned dividends (popularly known as profits) will be factored through <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s. It might also make sense to factor Belt levels (<em>i.e.</em>, let&rsquo;s do the experiment). For example, a Black Belt who has not contributed much to anybody in the last few months, might stop being a Black Belt.</p>
