<div style="display:none;">
 <p>You have a great idea, but no capital. And your friends love you, but are too busy to help you.</p>
</div>

<h1>Good News, Bad News</h1>
 <p>On the positive side,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You have a great idea</li>
   <li>The idea is good for our life-support system, Earth.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>TEST</p> 
 <p>On the other hand,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You don&rsquo;t have capital.</li>
   <li>Your friends love you, but they are busy with their own jobs and can&rsquo;t join your project.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>The Foundation</h1>
 <p>Simple,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <table class="_h2table_">
    <tr>
     <th>people</th>
     <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>commitments</th>
     <td>Decentralization & Transparency</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>practices</th>
     <td>Experimentation</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </div>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>Transparency: Secrecy is your enemy. Talk about your idea to as many people as you can <em>anywhere in the wold</em>. This will help you mold your idea. If felt great when you first thought of it, but it now has to be shaped, so lean on your social circle to help you do it. Transparency is your friend.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Decentralization: With all the talk about <em>teal</em> and the like, people will likely welcome decentralizing decision making, co-management; they may even be enthusiastic about it. On the other hand, when you talk about co-ownership you may get a neutral stare or curiosity, but be ready for disgust or ever-so-polite ridicule. They are not attacking you as much as they are trying to push away the thought you just put in their head. This is suddently seeing the invisible mounstrous ghost, so don&rsquo;t be suprised when people run away.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Meaning & Belonging: if you identify people who are really interested in this, don&rsquo;t let them go. And if they have skills that will help create your idea, hold on to them. If on top of that you want them in your team, you are very lucky!</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Experiment: Try variations on how you present co-ownership and co-management. IfRemember and reuse the stories that work.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

<h1>Borrowing, or Not</h1>
 <p>If you want to, and can, then borrow capital. Seed capital, as it is called, comes from friends, family, and fools. Friends and family know you and trust you; fools believe in you. They all want you to succeed.</p>
 <p>Seed capital is formalized as a legal Note that promises them, 1) their money back plus some upside, or 2) shares of the new company. But you new company <em>won&rsquo;t have shares</em>, so Notes are not applicable.</p>
 <p>Instead treat borrowed capital like a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investment which includes an upside to be paid on top of the principal over a period of time. 120% over two years, or double after five, or&hellip; whatever you think is realistic and reasonable. Explain that <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investments do not include any other powers. This won&rsquo;t be a surprise for the friends/family/fools crowd. It will most likely be a, perhaps unacceptable, surprise to traditional <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> capital investors. However, talk to them as well as a few are not so traditionalists and may be inspired enough to give you capital as a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span>-investment</p>
 <p>Once you have the capital it will go into whatever you have to buy and <em>the Predictable Recurring Income (PRI) fund</em>. Alternatively, you may forego borrowing any capital in which case there won&rsquo;t be PRI fund and co-owners must be willing to afford to wait for revenue.</p>

<h1>Hiring</h1>
 <p>You are not going to do any hiring, you are finding co-owners. You should repeat this, out loud, many times. Like a mantra.</p>
 <p>Since you are not hiring, you are not going to interview people. One way to not fall down the interview habit hole is to tell the person you are talking to that 1) you are looking for co-owners, not employees, 2) this is not an interview, and to 3) please, let me know when this starts to feel like one.</p>
 <p>What you are going to do next is to explain what PRI fund is and how it works.</p>

<h1>The PRI Fund</h1>
 <p>This is what the PRI is,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Until revenue starts to come in, the PRI Fund pays co-owners.</li>
   <li>Well, actually, it is not the revenue, but the earned dividends that pays the PRI Fund. Earned dividens is what is left of the review after paying off all expenses, etc.</li>
   <li>Even after earned dividends start to materialize, the PRI Fund may supplement a co-onwers&rsquo;s take home.</li>
   <li>Eventually, the earned dividends a co-owner gets starts to pay off co-owner&rsquo;s debt to the PRI fFundund. How much of it goes into paying PRI Fund depends on what co-owners agreed to.</li>
   <li>Finally, after the PRI debt is all paid up, co-owners take earned dividends home, in addition to their home pay.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>This is how <em>take home</em> is determined,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Each co-owner states what she needs to take home.</li>
   <li>If this figure is would, co-owners decide how to handle, say, the PRI Fund too drying too quickly.</li>
   <li>In the happy path, the stated figure is acceptable and doesn&rsquo;t cause any commotions.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>This is the important, and probably most contentious, thing of all: a withdrawal from the PRI Fund is <em>a personal debt</em> that a co-owner is responsible for. Other policies are plausible, but this seems to be the most reasonable. Co-owners are not exchanging their time for just a salary as is the case in <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> land and the people drawing from the PRI Fund are co-owners. Each need to realize that they are responsible for what they take out of fund.</p>
 <p>This means that co-onwers need to decide what to with people who exit while still having PRI debt. For example, you may decide to put limits on time (<span class="_quotespan">We have agreed to do this for six months&hellip;</span>) or amount (<span class="_quotespan">We have agreed to do this for as long as the $500,000 in the PRI Fund lasts</span>), or you want to have a discussion with the PRI debt to <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s falls too low. The point is that it is up to you, the co-owners.</p>

<h1>The <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> Mobile App</h1>
 <p>Co-owners use the <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> mobile app to recognize the contributions of other co-owners. The <em><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s!</em> app later converts these contributions into <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s at the end of each, say, monthly cycle.</p>
 <p>Co-owners can recognize anything as a contributions. These can range from a tangible benefit to the company (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; found us a place to store return merchandize for free.</span>) to something more intangible (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; took the time to talk to him and to help him get his mental health taken care of.</span> or even <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; it gave me a lot of joy when he did that.</span>)</p>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s can factor anything through them. For example, if I have 10% of the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s distributed and you have 20%, you get twice as much as I do of whatever is being filtered through the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s this time (<em>e.g.</em>, earned dividends).</p>

<h1>Explicit Alignment</h1>
 <p>Since you have co-owners, and no boss, you still to somehow align on what needs to get done, etc., and that is what the Explicit Alignment tool is about,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/en-alignment.svg"
   width="70%"
   alt="">
 </div>
 <p>Co-owners should get together as soon as possible, or sooner, to figure out answers to the questions in the Explicit Alignment below. This is extremely key.</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_background">
   <tr>
    <th>Impact<br><span class="_alignquestions">what for?</span></th>
    <td>What impact they want to make (<em>i.e.</em>, be remembered by). For example, <span class="_quotespan">Improve people&rsquo;s health.</span></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Purpose<br><span class="_alignquestions">why?</span></th>
    <td>Why are we doing this for? For example, <span class="_quotespan">Easy to get, healthy foods.</span></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Mission<br><span class="_alignquestions">what?<br>when?<br>how?</span></th>
    <td>What are doing, when, and how? For example, <span class="_quotespan">We already have a partner farm that will harvest by end the of April. We mean to sign up the first 100 customers by the end of March.</span></td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </div>
 <p>These not cast in stone, but have different rates of change,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The <b>Mission</b> will change as often as necessary. If there is more than one team, each team may have its own mission, but it must align with the company&rsquo;s <b>Impact</b> and <b>Purpose</b>.</li>
   <li>The <b>Purpose</b> will change less often, but it could change as new co-onwers join.</li>
   <li>The <b>Impact</b> should not change at all, at least not without a deep discussion. This may happen, but it is a major thing, equivalent to creating a new company.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Explicit Relationships</h1>
 <p>n Explicit Relationship is a guide to an exploration among would-be co-owners to make sure that they can get aligned and they want to work with each other. Even if this is a relative or somebody you know very well, don&rsquo;t skip doing the Explicit Relationship. Maybe it turns out to be perfectly boring or you may discover surprises along the way.</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_h2table">
   <tr>
    <th>Umwelt</th>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>How do you show up? Who are you?</li>
      <li>Why do you need others?</li>
      <li>What do you feel we need to agree on?</li>
      <li>What are your red lines?</li>
      <li>Anything else?</li>
      <li>What gets you angry?</li>
      <li>What shuts you up?</li>
      <li>What makes you excited?</li>
      <li>What we really need to know is what does each of the above look like?</li>
      <li>How would we know if you are angry, feel shut up, or excited?</li>
      <li>Anything else?</li>
     </ul>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Vulnerabilty</th>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>What are you biggest fears?</li>
      <li>Do you speak up? How?</li>
      <li>Do you need to be given permission to speak? <span class="_quotespan">You didn&rsquo;t ask me!</span></li>
      <li>Anything else?</li>
     </ul>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Collaboration</th>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>What is meaningful to you?</li>
      <li>What gives you joy?</li>
      <li>How can we help you collaborate with us?</li>
      <li>What stops you on your tracks?</li>
      <li>How can we avoid doing that?</li>
      <li>How do we know when you are collaborating? How do you show up?</li>
      <li>What impact you have to have?</li>
     </ul>
    </td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </div>
 <p>Also, please, take a look at our Foundation table and our Alignment table, particularly its <b>Impact</b> and <b>Purpose</b>.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>What thoughts does this bring up?</li>
   <li>Does it work for you?</li>
   <li>Does anything need to change or be clarified for you?</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Our recomendation is that you allot one hour each to Mindset, Transparency, and <b>Collaboration</b>. We have spend many more that three hours on these, and it has been very worth it. Doing it will get you to a level of trust with other co-owners that <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses don&rsquo;t ever get near. This practice creates a foundation for the relationships that are so important to our success.</p>

<h1>In Summary&hellip;</h1>
 <p>To create a RADICAL startup, do whatever works for you. We are not preaching a dogma, only a way to do it more easily and with a definite intention to get away from the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> way of doing thigs..</p>

     <th>Foundation</th>
     <td>
      <p>Start by agreeing to an explicit foundation, a root. The Foundation we offered here is simple and easy to remember. As the company grows, the Foundation will help you figure out if, for example, it is more or less Transparent or Decentralized. If you need to add other elements on top, do it.</p>

     <th>Borrowing Capital</th>
     <td>
      <p>Borrowin capital is an option, but do not trade capital for &ldquo;control&rdquo; or any such <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> concept. And don't fool yourself with what you hope to do &ldquo;later.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Likely, you will need for the PRI fund. If that is the case, make it a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investment.</p>
