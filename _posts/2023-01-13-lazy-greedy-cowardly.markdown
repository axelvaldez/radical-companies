 <p>Lazy. Greedy. Cowardly. These are violent words. The words of shaming and gloating.</p>

  <p>“You lost because you are lazy.”</p>
  <p>“Greedy bastard, aren’t you getting enough?”</p>

 <p>Lazy. Greedy. Cowardly. These are violent words. The words of shaming and gloating. The words of competition.</p>

<h1>It Won’t Work</h1>
 <p>Even when <em>we say</em> we want to collaborate, we are most likely competing, aiming to dominate. That’s all we’ve learned and all we see in the world around us. And, so, that’s what we do even when we intend to do otherwise.</p>

     <p>Name dropping is a tool of competition.</p>
     <p>In the FIAT world, you have to build up your credibility before people listen to you, and quoting “experts,” “authorities,” and other well known people builds your credibility.</p>
     <p>So, you learn to do it all the time hoping that one day it will let you get in the real race.</p>

<h1>Let’s Compete</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Raising your voice to shut others down.</li>
  <li>Interrupting to establish dominance.</li>
  <li>Talking (and talking) for a long time.</li>
  <li>Adding “please” at the end of direct orders.</li>
  <li>Repeating yourself, over and over.</li>
  <li>Even saying “sorry, but that’s what I feel” after a show of aggression is an act of competition. Even if you <em>are</em> sorry, the damage is done.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Collaborate Out of Love</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Listen.</li>
  <li>Paraphrase.</li>
  <li>Celebrate.</li>
  <li>Add to others ideas.</li>
  <li>If you don’t like something or disagree, <em>say so</em>. Don’t punch holes in others’ ideas.</li>
 </ul>  

<h1>Competition, Collaboration</h1>
 <p>Collaboration doesn’t mean agreeing to everything. Collaboration means the capacity to create something together.</p>
 <p>Competition means to have my attractor dominate. It becomes meaningful when everybody agrees with me. It becomes practical when everybody works on it. Even if it takes some form of violence.</p>
 <p>Collaboration is multiple views moving towards an attractor, making it meaningful. Going to the root of the radical attractor. Collaboration means creating the conditions for this attractor to become meaningful to others. No violence is ever involved.</p>

<h1>Competition Means&hellip;</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Dividing people. &ldquo;Humanity needs a strong leader.&rdquo; This way of thinking makes the boss different, above the people who work for him.</li>
  <li>Other divisions,
   <ul>
    <li>Owners and employees.</li>
    <li>Middle class and poor.</li>
    <li>House owners, house renters, apartment dwellers.</li>
    <li>Men and women.</li>
    <li>Juveniles, Adults, Old.</li>
    <li>Organized religions.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Taking hopefulness and dignity out out of work that the non-owners have to do, because they are not owners.</li>
  <li>Hopefulness and dignity things lie outside the work I need them to do.</li>
  <li>Only coins count as motivators.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Collaboration Means&hellip;</h1>
  <ul>
   <li>What we are doing is meaningful to all involved.</li>
   <li>I work with people who are always ready to help me find meaning and dignity.</li>
   <li>There is no boss. We align, and we work and we create. It’s all decentralized but cogent.</li>
   <li>Everything is fully transparent. No exceptions.</li>
   <li>We consider all we do an experiment. It either works as expected, or we learn.</li>
  </ul>
