 <p>Time for an alternative to the bug.</p>
</div>

<h1>Fiat Has Been Good</h1>
 <p>The Fiat system has been good. For more than a few people. It created the middle class, improved education, medicine, and science, etc. Poeple in the US, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand live better.</p>
 
 <p>But people of European descent live best. Not all of them, mind you, generally that is the case. Human kind have moved forward.</p>

 <h1>Climate Change</h1>
  <p>Then there is Clinmate Change, which of course could be a hoax and the fires and destructive storms we are suffering through are just the result of our over stimulated imagination.</p>
  
  <p>Or it could be urgently true because Climat Change is already here.</p>
  
  <p>But, hey, lets talk about it because we could be leaving money on the table.</p>

<h1>Money</h1>
  <p>But money is not the priority, people are: people&rsquo;s lives are.</p>
   <div class="_citation" >
    <p>&ldquo;People are starvingp and I feel bad for them,&rdquo; so what are you doing about it?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Those poor people in Gaza, I feel for them,&rdquo; so what are you doing about it?</p>
   </div>

  <p>It is not the act of charity (thank you). It is not participation at a demonstration and getting arrested (thank you). And it idefinitely not a revolution with blood on the streets, terror, and all that (Karl Marx instigated for that and it failed, big time).</p>
  
  <p>We need to provide an alternative system that explicitly makes people&rsquo;s lives the top priority. Once we changed a few minds we will be on our way of fixing Climate Change and all the other bad things that Fiat brings with it.</p>
