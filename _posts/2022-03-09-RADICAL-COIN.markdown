# RADICAL COIN
## FOR A WORLD-WIDE MARKET

> If Kings had figured out

# Introduction

Today, money    is the canonical medium of exchange and that is what we assumed in our book, RADICAL COMPANIES. After all, we need money to pay our bills and as a medium of exchange to buy stuff. Unfortunately, money also supports hoarding as a way to accumulate financial wealth and power over everything, including people. This is problematic and leads to the most serious problems we face today.

For this and other reasons, I now believe that we should have a RADICAL COIN that doesn’t have the baggage of national fiat money and can help us transform our economy to be more human-centric.
Like today’s money, COINs function as,
+ A unit of measure
+ Store of value
+ Medium of exchange

In addition, and this is critical, COINs are transparent in the sense that an integral part of each COIN is its log of information from which potential risks and benefits can be calculated.

COINs are also decentralized. Companies will be the guarantors of COINs. Not banks. Not governments. Not international accords. This will make the costs of all transactions negligible.

Our goal is that a decentralized and transparent COIN will make possible a world-wide market that we can all play in without intermediaries.

## Some Terminology

---
| National Fiat Coin  | Throughout the rest of this document, you will notice that I stubbornly use “national fiat coin,” instead of “money” or “currency.” This is mostly to remind myself of a few key distinctions,
+ “Money” is primarily a concept
+ “Coins” are a tangible instance of money.
+ “Fiat money” is coinage created by fiat, out of whole cloth. It used to be that you needed gold to create coins, but not anymore.

As a unit of measure, a national fiat coin works like a meter or a minute and serves as a stable denominator for transactions. However, while the meter and the minute are world-wide units, fiat coins are a national thing. This makes them very unstable and fragile as a unit of measure (e.g., imagine a minute being “devalued” or something being measured in 仪表). 

National fiat coins act as a store of value by virtue of their fixed nominal value. This means that these coins can be used to accumulate financial wealth. From that perspective, national fiat coins do not deserve to be called “currency,” not while stuffed under the proverbial mattress.

National fiat coins serve as a medium of exchange. This is the prevailing message that governments, banks, and the whole financial industry repeats over and over. At one point exchange was based on the value of gold, but since the 1970s the system is based on each country’s say so, national fiat coins. National governments talk about this as the best thing since sliced bread, and international accords have tried to cobble together a market out of them, but the whole arrangement is very fragile and under constant threat. |

Currency
Another common name for national fiat coins is “currency.” It means to indicate that money flows from one person to the next to facilitate the exchange of commodities. But national fiat coins don’t always flow.
Because coins hold their value forever, they can be hoarded to accumulate financial wealth in bank accounts or under the proverbial mattress.
Given this, national fiat coins do not deserve to be called “currency.”


To avoid confusion, I use “money” to refer to the concept, “national fiat coin” to refer to what we normally mean by money, and “currency” not at all.
Historical Perspective
COINs are not to be confused, or conflated, with local or complementary currencies, demurrage money, or any such. Ditto for Mutualism, Marxism, or any other theory or ideology. The point of COIN is to make it possible to have a market, free of intermediaries, and with negligible costs.
In fact, although they are not identical, COINs are very similar to national fiat coins. They are a unit of measure, a store of value, and a medium of exchange, but with these twists,
They represent value at its broadest. In addition to financial value, they account for wellbeing, contributions, acts of kindness, and all the other things that are important to people.
They spread risks and benefits through society. We all share in the adventure: the burden of risk and the joys of gains.
COINs bypass the complications and costs brought about by banks, exchanges, national politics, and the influence of transnationals.
COINs have the potential to enable a world-wide market. This will help us break out of our national silos, create an economy that’s decentralized and transparent.
Worth Repeating
This may be a difficult read and it may be worth repeating here a few words about the RADICAL framework and how it’s different from our current world. Probably the most confusing thing about it is that a RADICAL world would be very similar to our current world. People will be the same with all our jealousies, overreactions, and habits. They will be embarrassed by overpromising and want to sweep under the proverbial rug.
The only difference—the big difference—is that the RADICAL system is centered around our interdependence.
Our current system is based on separating us: countries, towns, good and bad neighborhoods; political parties and their vastly different realities; need to know, secrecy, protection. This leaves us disconnected and drives us to isolation. Businesses are built on creating platforms to bring us back together, for a fee. This works for a world where money comes first, ahead of everything else.
A RADICAL world, too, is centered around accomplishments and real innovation, but it prioritizes what’s important to people first, ahead of everything else, including money. We’ll still be individuals, with our own needs, rights, and idiosyncrasies. We are not going to become a number. The RADICAL model is centered on trust, the type that comes from community and collaboration.
The RADICAL Model
We are used to companies being governed by FIAT hierarchies, with an owner at the top sending down commands telling people what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. Here we assume a RADICAL world that is, at the same time, alike and different from our world today.
In the RADICAL model, a company is a group of people coming together to create something bigger than each of them. Other labels abound, but we chose the word “company” because it has an interesting genesis: it comes from the Latin con- and pan. The prefix con- means “together, with” and pan means “bread, food.” At its root, then, company means “people who break bread together.” In the RADICAL model a company is a community of people who come together to contribute broad value to society and make an impact on the world.
Rather than having an owner and a hierarchy of bosses, a RADICAL company has co-owners and co-managers to govern and operate it. These people align themselves according to the impact they want to make, why they are doing so, and then they embark on many experiments to get there..


They do this starting from a simple foundation of interdependence,
Meaning & Belonging
Principles
relationships


Transparency & Decentralization
Commitments
autonomy


Alignment & Experimentation
Practices
collaboration





Evolution, Interrupted
As I see it, the RADICAL model of co-ownership and co-management is the next stage in collaboration. Everything humanity has accomplished has been based on collaboration, but we have acted as if dominance by a few is the only way to achieve it.
The dominance model of collaboration has become an obstacle to real progress and it is now getting in the way of the next surge of human accomplishments. Now it’s time to move on and build on the foundation of interdependence towards a higher level of collaboration.
A World-Wide Market
A world-wide market would bring us together rather than keeping us siloed by the Rube Goldberg markets we have today.
We could have a single world government create and enforce a single currency. But even if it were politically feasible, it is unnecessary and a move in the wrong direction towards centralization. To wit, we didn’t need a single world government for minutes, meters, or the Internet, some of the most useful world-wide tools of all time.
A decentralized, transparent COIN is fundamental to such a unified market. These are some of the other things we would need to nourish and support a world-wide market,
Decentralized Market
We need a decentralized market to nurture the next stage of innovation and accomplishment.
National fiat coins are not very stable and bring with them a lot of cyclical crises. They make international markets very complex, opaque, and very expensive.
Today’s international markets have been cobbled together by agreements that are fraught with weaknesses. National and international politics make transaction costs very expensive. Worst of all, these international markets are unduly influenced by transnational businesses seeking to profit no matter the harm to society.
A decentralized market can truly be a pricing engine, free of interference and manipulation.
Decentralized Minting
We need decentralized minting of COINs to take national and international politics out of it and to eliminate the influence of transnational corporations.
COINs are minted by companies, not any national government or central banks.
Transparent COINs
National fiat coins are opaque. In theory that’s good because it reduces transaction costs. But this “reduction of costs” also disables human choice.
In any case, the big transaction costs are those that banks, exchanges, and political manipulation bring in. And opaqueness does not reduce any of those.
RADICAL COINs are transparent. An integral part of each COIN is the log that comes along with them. This will restore people’s  ability to make choices based on that information.
Trusted Measure
A measure can be “trusted” because it means the same thing to people anywhere. RADs, too, can be trusted if you believe that people are pretty much the same anywhere.
In a rural setting somebody will get RADs for milking a goat, while in an urban setting someone else will get RADs for stopping cars so children can cross the street. The same human feeling that acted in the rural case was active in the urban setting. The value of capturing that feeling in tangible ways is more important than its number accuracy. RADs, and the COINs that they factor, can be trusted because the “pricing engine,” meaning each of us, is the same.
RAD Distributions
This idea originated with entrepreneur and pioneer Philip Rosedale. This is a practice that he’s deployed at his various businesses,
As the company grows, every month an equal amount of cash and shares of the company are earmarked for distribution.
Every member gets an equal portion of the wealth the company generated.
Rather than keeping them for themselves, people give this money and shares out to anybody they feel has contributed during the month.
There is no set criteria and each person decides who should be recognized, what should be recognized as a contribution, and how much to give to others.
The RADICAL Distributions is very similar, but instead of cash or stocks, it uses RADs, a dimensionless unit. At the end of each Distribution the total number of RADs allocated to each person represents their dynamic percentage of ownership of the broad value created by a company.
Because broad value accounts for things other than financial value, RADs account for the uncountable. And because COINs are factored through RADs, they represent broad value as well. In other words, each person's share of COINs is a function of their contributions and reflects the full spectrum of human values, not just financial value.
COIN
These are a few of the qualities that a COIN must have. They are in no particular order.
Decentralized Minting
COINs are minted by companies, not a national government.

For example, BenCO mints 30,000 COINs and promises to repay them in three years. All this information goes on a transparent digital store (e.g., blockchain or similar secure) that would include, at a minimum,
The amount of COINs (30,000),
The name of the company which minted them (BenCO),
The retiring terms (three years),
The repayment terms (10,000 COINs/year).
This can result in any of these scenarios,
Happy
Ending
BenCO retires the 30,000 COINs within three years, as promised.




Not so
Happy
Ending
BenCO has retired only two thirds of the minted COIN by the third year. It does retire all 30,000 COIN, but later than promised.




Unhappy
Ending
BenCO disbands and never creates enough value for society to pay the 30,000 COINs.





A seller’s app can calculate a risk factor based on the BenCO COIN’s log and her particular preset parameters. Each of us can let the apps do the calculations and, based on that, decide whether or not to take the BenCO COINs as payment.
Stability
In today’s system of exchange, “reserve currencies” are used for international transactions. This makes these transactions very expensive.
As of this writing, the four most widely held “reserve currencies” are the US dollar ($), the European Euro (€), the Japanese Yen (¥), and the UK Pound Sterling (£). These national fiat coinage are backed up by strong, stable economies. At least, that’s how the story goes.
As guarantors of COINs, how do companies compare with national economies? For one, national economies are not as stable as all that and financial crises happen on a cyclical basis. For another, people invariably find ways to exploit some aspect of the financial system for private gain. Politicians are very good at this and manipulate national economies shamelessly. For example, in 1971 then President Nixon renounced gold as a standard and blamed it mostly on De Gaulle’s policies. In reality, he did it to maintain “global economic dominance and to improve economic conditions at home.”
By comparison, companies are extremely stable because their reputation depends solely on how effective they are at creating value for society. That’s it. The worst that can happen is that a company mints COINs and then it is not able, or willing, to retire the debt. The financial impact of this would be insignificant; to wit, this is what happens today.
Fungible
In today’s financial model, to be effective as a medium of exchange, money must be fungible—one coin is indistinguishable from all others. “Trying to use a non-fungible good as money results in transaction costs of individually evaluating each unit of the good before an exchange can take place.”
Thankfully, COINs are fungible, world-wide. Their transaction costs, nationally and internationally, are negligible. Their only transaction cost is that of “evaluating” each payment and whether or not to accept the risk associated with it. But this is automated and insignificant. The other cost is deciding whether to accept a given mix of COINs as payment, and that carries no financial cost since most transactions would be driven by the app’s results and the few exceptions to it would be driven by people to people relationships. This takes those transactions out of the financial realm and into a people-to-people one.
Broad Value
To be robust, a COIN needs to be tied to value creation, and COINs are. In fact they represent more than financial value. Their value also represents wellbeing, acts of kindness, and whatever else people consider important. And since COINs are factored through RADs they represent broad value contributions as well.
For example, if the RADs that have been allocated to me amount to 10% of the total and yours to 20%, this means that our fellow co-owners decided that you contributed twice as much as I did. As a result you get twice as many COINs as I do.
Transparent
National fiat coins are opaque. We make do with things like GDP, but GDP and others like it don’t measure anything besides financial value. They are canonical examples of the Broken Window Fallacy and don’t take into account society-wide costs. What’s more, these indices can be very misleading, and “GDP can increase after a car accident or a major flood. GDP can grow rapidly during a war or after a terrorist attack.”
COINs are transparent and we need them to be. Each COIN carries with it a log of all the information necessary to calculate the potential risks and benefits associated with it. Given that information, each of us can then decide whether or not to accept a particular COIN as payment.
COIN Value
The face value of national fiat coins is fixed forever. At least, that is true for reserve currencies. Other national fiat coins are not so lucky: their face value stays put, but their purchasing power fluctuates, sometimes wildly.
COINs have a face value of one. It is backed by people who come together as RADICAL COMPANIES to create broad value for society. It is free from national and international politics and manipulation.
The face value of COINs never changes but the information in its log may. Based on all of that, each of us gets to decide whether or not to accept the COINs given the risks and benefits indicated in its log..
Company Value
As it is today, different companies will end up with different values and their co-owners will have more or less purchasing power. For example,
Company BenCO earns 100 COINs.
Company JerryCo earns 1,000 COINs.
JerryCo’s value is higher than BenCO.
JerryCO people earn more COINs than those at BenCO.
Guarantors
COINs are backed up by the RADICAL COMPANIES, not national governments. This means that the COIN’s “value” is determined by what each company brings to society and by its co-owners’ sensitivities.
This last bit is really important.
In today’s businesses, the owners can do whatever they want. Although the same is technically true for a RADICAL COMPANY it will be a lot more unlikely that all co-owners would agree to do something that goes against their own values and communities.
For example, if a community feels harmed by the actions of CarelessCO they can make their case to a few of its co-owners to at least get a conversation going. If the harm affects many such communities and all its co-owners refuse to engage, they can simply record the failed discussion to CarelessCO’s COINs. Some people may interpret this as a high risk (to society) while others may see it differently. We all get to decide.
Risks and Benefits
There is plenty of evidence that shows that a currency, one that actually actually flows, can benefit a society, while money stuffed under a mattress only benefits the hoarder.
One way to keep money flowing is by having it lose its value over time (i.e., there is no point in hoarding it because it will “rot”). This can be done by inflation or demurrage. Inflation, the decline of purchasing power, has been the preferred method of national governments for controlling the value and availability of its coinage. Governments can do this by tweaking interest rates, which impacts the supply of national fiat coins. For most of us, this all happens very mysteriously. We all know that “inflation is bad,” but we cannot do anything about it.
The other approach is by demurrage where coins lose their value over time. There’s been a number of local deployments of demurrage coins and they are generally beneficial to the local economy. However, as far as I know, demurrage has never been used at a national level. The poster child of demurrage is the "Miracle of Wörgl." During the Great Depression, the town of Wörgl, Austria, was quickly running out of money, like most of the world. The mayor issued Wörgls to pay people for doing local jobs and the local shops agreed to accept them. The bills had to be stamped every week in order to keep them valid, and every stamp reduced the value of these coins. This kept the notes in circulation. So much so, that people even paid taxes earlier rather than let their currency “rot.”


The bills had "52 spaces on the reverse side, one for each week of the year, and the scrip was to have the value of its stated denomination only for one week"



One problem with demurrage is that its rate of decay is not tied to value creation or anything like it. For example, kept its face value for a week Wörgl and went down in value every week thereafter. The Wära, another demurrage coin, lost 1% of its value every month. These rates of decay are, for all intents and purposes, picked out of thin air.
COINs, on the other hand, are always the same value. What changes is the potential risks and benefits associated with the company that engendered it. Every COIN carries a log of all the information people need to decide whether or not to accept it.

Calculating Risk
A COIN‘s log may include, for example, the number of co-owners that agree to its mint, the company’s revenue history, how many COINs the company has minted, and the company’s debt performance. Given the COIN’s log, we can calculate the risk associated with every COIN and decide whether or not to accept a particular COIN as payment.
One side-effect of this, is that people will try to dilute what risk they hold by paying with a combination of low and high risk COINs, enough of each to make the risk acceptable to the seller.
Calculating Benefits
Over time, companies will go up in value because they get very efficient, benefit from high demand, or both. People will likely hold on to their COINs. It may be that they are more comfortable with risk and may not mind taking higher risk COINs from fledgling companies. It may also be that even the more conservative folks may be tempted to take high risk COINs from high potential companies.

Other Value Factors
Other things that may affect company value,
As a company creates more value, it gets more revenue, and it generates more COINs. The revenue COINs are allocated according to each person’s broad contributions. Co-owners decide what is a broad contribution according to the value they perceive.
If a company walks away from debt, it’s reputation goes down, and its COINs go down in value.
As a company retires debt, its reputation goes up, and its COINs go up in value.
If the reputation and value of a company goes up, its COINs go down in risk. Those who took its COINs when they were high risk now have more desirable COINs. The upside spreads throughout society.
Companies that are constantly creating debt and not retiring it, will find themselves isolated. Their COINs will get riskier and riskier and they will be acceptable to fewer and fewer people. Hopefully, they will see guidance and help from others.
TADDA!
RADs account for what so far has been unaccountable. People get to decide what a contribution is and by doing so they “measure” what has been unmeasurable: an act of kindness, spontaneous help. Co-owners get COINs according to the percentage of RADs they have and that makes COINs a much broader measure than just financial value.
Companies mint COINs. This means that COINs are decentralized and free of interference by national and international politics, financial institutions, and too-big-to-fail transnationals. COINs will make it possible to create a world-wide market that Adam Smith would be happy with.
The whole system is transparent and each of us can decide to accept a payment or not. It is not mysterious or left to robed experts to figure things out. Each of us can do it because each of us is an expert on our own sensitivities and how we interpret the world.
APPENDICES
Bad Actors
There may not be as many bad actors as we think. We probably have a preponderance of them today because 1) they make the news, and 2) we live in a system that is meant to reward bad behavior: gaming is part and parcel of the system. As we find out, we patch it to prevent other bad actors from exploiting the same weakness. But then the next batch of bad actors become wealthy by discovering and exploiting new weaknesses.
We don’t normally think of these, below, as bad actors. But they are. They fall back on their FIAT world habits and are a drag on moving forward to a RADICAL world.
Going Along
One type of “bad actor” is people who “go along.” We normally don’t think of them as bad actors, “they’re just nice people.” In any case, Shui is one of them. He notices that Namir is taking more than he contributed, but he doesn’t say anything and talks to Namir. Shui turns a blind eye towards Namir's bad behavior and goes by untested assumptions. “Namir is a nice guy and maybe he needs a little bit more than me.”




Battling Ghosts
The other type of bad actor is the one who gets pulled into behavior that he normally would not condone.
For example, Anita, a BenCO co-owner, wants to buy potatoes. The potato seller, Shui, looks at the COINs coming from her, but refuses to accept them. It turns out that all of Anita’s COINs come from BenCO and the company has not lived up to its promises. Shui is a very conservative type and he refuses to exchange her COINs for his potatoes. She explains the reasons why they had not made the first year payment on time, “and we will by the end of this week.” Nevertheless, Shui is unmoved and puts the potatoes back in their bin.
Further down the road, Namir sees the same log that Shui got, but he, nevertheless, accepts Anita’s COINs in exchange for his potatoes. It turns out that Namir knows Anita and what they are doing at BenCO and he trusts that they will retire their debts.
Shui sees the exchange, misinterprets it, and instead of talking with Namir he goes on to accept higher risk COINs that he is comfortable with. Instead of talking to Namir and figuring out what’s going on, he falls into his own trap of assuming Namir is out to take business away from him.




Convenience
Other Bad Actors act out of convenience. I’ll let Seth Godin describe this one,
“Social convenience: it’s easier to sit through a boring cocktail party or a meeting than it is to tell someone you don’t want to come.
“Physical convenience: things that are handy are much more likely to be chosen than ones that require us to move somewhere to go get them.
“Intellectual convenience: change makes us uncomfortable. Sunk costs are hard to ignore. Possibility comes with agency, and agency comes with risk.
“Financial convenience: if it’s cheaper in the short run, we’re more likely to choose it, even if it costs satisfaction, opportunity or cash in the long run.
“Cultural convenience: A combination of all of these, because culture likes the status quo and reminds of this regularly.”







Varying Buying Power
I am selling potatoes at 40 COINs per dozen. After the first month Ⓐ, below, and his co-owners don’t have enough COINs to buy my potatoes, but Ⓔ and his co-owners do. It may be that JerryCO is more efficient or maybe its products or services are more valuable. Either way, BenCO’s co-owners end up with less buying power than JerryCO’s co-owners.

Within each company, the buying power of an individual co-owner, too, can change every cycle. For example, in the illustration above, by the third cycle Ⓔ, a JerryCO co-owner who started with 100 COINs, now has 1,200 which are enough to buy 30 dozen of my potatoes. Other other hand, JerryCO co-owner Ⓗ didn't get any COINs this cycle and he only has 600 COINs and has to settle for 15 dozen of my potatoes.

FAQ
Companies minting COINs without any rules sounds really, really!
If that sounds “crazy,” then the financial system we have today is crazier and business hostile.
COINs minted by BenCO carry a log which includes all the information related to their creation. The co-owners are motivated to retire the COINs they minted in the time promised. If they don’t do that, fewer and fewer sellers will accept their COINs. Their buying power will go down the drain in a hurry.
Why not make co-owners responsible for personally retiring the debt?

What prevents a company from continuously taking on new debt to retire old debt?
Co-owners could decide to do this, but it goes on the record, so to speak, for everyone to see. As sellers detect that pattern, they would shy away from the company’s COINs.
What if co-owners pay themselves a huge amount of COINs and keep taking new debt to paper over it? Wouldn’t this create massive inflation?
Co-owners could decide to do this, but it goes on the record, so to speak, for everyone to see. As sellers detect that pattern, they would shy away from the company’s COINs. They may have lots and lots of COINs, but they would not be welcome by most people.
Let’s say that the potato grower uses the COINs he got from selling her potatoes to buy a shovel. But then the town’s shovel-maker raised his prices so that he can buy metal and wood dowels to make more shovels.
Yes, that could happen, as it does today.
Eventually, another shovel-maker would appear and make shovels that people can afford. The greedy shovel maker would go out of business.
PotatoCO mints COINs to pay for the now higher priced shovel.
If PotatoCO’s co-owners figure that the new price is a fair price and there’s no other supplier around, it would have to do that. They would have to make sure that they can get enough COINs from future potatoes to retire the debt as promised. Otherwise, they are going to pay with a lower reputation and value and less buying power for the co-owners.
People will continue to make mistakes and miss estimates. COINs won’t change human nature. But co-owners can mint the COINs they need to run their companies without worrying about the color of their skin, or their gender, or church affiliation.
But this means that another potato grower buys a tractor and grows even more potatoes!
Yes. This means that people can experiment more.
Maybe the tractor turns out to be a lemon and doesn’t help him produce more or better potatoes. He probably won’t be able to retire the debt he took on to buy it.
What if JerryCO, a brand new startup with no revenue, needs COINs to get started, can it just mint them?
In this case, most vendors would likely not accept JerryCO’s COINs as payments because its COINs would have very high risk.
In this case, other companies may want to help out JerryCO by giving them COINs. One or more companies could mint enough COINs for JerryCO  to get to revenue or to build its minimum viable product. This could include vendors of equipment that JerryCO needs to succeed and the quid pro quo is that they will become JerryCO’s preferred vendors.
Alternatively, the investment may come from a group of adjacent companies. They believe that JerryCO’s product is complementary to theirs and will help the market grow. Or JerryCO promises to “repay” twice the original amount of this investment.
In any case, as JerryCO starts to show results and a pattern of doing as promised, the risk of its own COINs will go down and will be able to pay with a mix of its own COINs and co-investment COINs.
What if a BenCO co-owner wants to buy the latest electric, self-driving car, but she doesn’t get enough COINs? Can’t she convince the other co-owners to pay themselves more COINs?
For BenCO co-owners to pay themselves a lot more COINs than they actually receive in revenue, they would have to mint the extra COINs. These newly minted COINs would show a lot of risks and sellers would likely not accept them as payment, particularly for luxury items.
Do you mean that there is no possible way to defraud the system?
It simply means that I can’t think of a way of doing that.
Every time I think of something, the system manages to protect itself. And it is all because of the transparency built into it.
I can imagine that there could be a way to falsify a COIN’s log, but I’ll leave that to smarter people.
Why can’t people mint COINs? Why is it limited to companies?
Community!
In the RADICAL model, a company is a community of people who come together to contribute broad value to society and make an impact in the world. This means that co-owners may be motivated to mind COINs, but the risks of doing so may hold them back. Do we believe that we can retire the debt? Can we do as we are promising?
Maybe individuals can weigh all those considerations by themselves, but I know I couldn’t, at least not in a balanced way. When the pros and cons are weighed by the broader consideration of a community, the final decision is more balanced.
What if a company mints COINs and then is not able to retire the debt?
Yes, this kind of thing will happen. And, in case you’re asking, there is no punishment for the people involved in this.
The overall costs will be negligible. It happens all the time today and nobody notices. Yes, the people involved in a bankruptcy get punished, ruthlessly so. But the system absorbs the losses, magically.
What about people who retired on their CarelessCO’s COINs?
I think that in a RADICAL world, “retiring” will be a thing of the past (i.e., our present). People “retire” today because they’ve been putting up with their job for many years and they are burned out in more ways than one.
In a RADICAL world, the more likely scenario is that people may decide to not join another company for a while and live instead off their portfolio of RADs from their past companies. This type of “retiring” will not be a function of age or tiresomeness, it will be of choice.
So, let’s say that I decide to travel the world on a sailboat, paying for it with CarelessCO’s COINs and CarelessCO disbands. There could be three cases,
The COINs I have are pre-disband and their log attests to it. I feel bad because they had a lot of potential, but they got careless and cocky, over-promised, and could not meet their commitments.
The COINs I have are mostly pre-disband, but I do have some that the company minted. The amount is very minor, I’ll have to switch to a smaller boat. Besides, I am earning COINs while on the boat by writing about my journey.
All the COINs I have are the ones discredited. In fact, I was one of the co-owners who supported the minting (we were sure we could do it). In this case, I screwed myself financially, but I learned something in the process. I have to return the boat and join WiserCO.
What if lots of companies disband at the same time?
Then you adjust your app to raise the risk of similar companies.
What about people who cannot work?
Some people will be unable to contribute to a company, for whatever reason. But to their family
Is risk associated with companies or with COINs?
A COINs log includes all the information needed to calculate the COIN’s potential risk and benefits. But, this date comes from the company behind the minted COINs. In all likelihood, it would include the number of co-owners who agreed to the mint and its how well they’ve kept to their promises. It would also include that a case has been made by several communities that the company is harming them and whether or not the situation has been resolved to the communities’ satisfaction.
For each COINs, the log holds facts, not judgements and each of us gets to decide what to do with them.
