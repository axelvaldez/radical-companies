 <p>Patient-centric healthcare is what we need and want. Money-making sickcare is what we have.</p>

 <p>Patient-centric healthcare is what we want. Money-making sickcare is what we have.</p>

<h1>rHatchery.live</h1>
 <p>In the <em>rHatchery.live</em> podcast, Bindu Kalesan, Epidemiologist and founder of Tury Health, talked about her startup. She mentioned that they can bring the costs of clinical trials to one-tenth of what they are today, at $30,000. They can do that by making the trial patient-centric rather than focused on location or anything else.</p>
 <p>Besides the dollar savings this results in trials that include people of color (PoC), which are normally not included because trials have not been designed for inclusivity. The result is that today most of the drugs available are not been tested for PoC side-effects.</p>

<h1>Lieracy</h1>

<h1>Sickcare</h1>
 <p>What also talked about the care we have today which Bindu called <em>sickcare</em>, which is what we really have today.</p>
 <p>If don&rsquo;t feel well, you go the doctor&rsquo;s office. Fifteen-minute per patient, which is what insurace businesses pushes physician to do, does not give a physician time to do anything but a cursory examination followed by a covered prescription. I am lucky that my own family doctor does not care about making lots of money, but it&rsquo;s just my lucky-me luck. Physicians getting started now are under intense pressure to dance to the insurance business music.</p>

<h1>Re-Start</h1>
 <p>As we were talking about all this, Bindu mentioned that we need is <span class="_quotespan">a patient-centric halthcare system, not the money-making sickcare system we have today.</span> She warned that <span class="_quotespan">it will take a long time to do so.</span></p>
 <p>As we continued talking, it became apparent to us that co-ownership could be part of making this happen. But rather than thinking about &ldquo;policies&rdquo; and such, it would be more effective to take a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> approach. That has the potential to make it faster.</p>

<h1>Speculation</h1>
