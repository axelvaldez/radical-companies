 <p>You are about to learn about an alternative way, where traditional boundaries crumble. It will challenge the status quo, spark your imagination, and leave an indelible mark on the world.</p>
</div>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
 <p>You are about to learn about an alternative way, where traditional boundaries crumble. Be ready for a journey that will challenge the status quo, spark your imagination, and leave an indelible mark on the world. Imagine a journey that encourages the audacity of dreams, where pioneers emerge to lead the way into uncharted territories, groundbreaking ideas that invite you to be part of a movement that shapes the future.</p>

 <p>Together, we will challenge the status quo and propel humanity towards new horizons. We embrace calculated risks, harnessing the power of playfulness and innovation to paths untraveled. We redefine the very fabric of success. Together, we will embark on a journey of possibilities and drive change on an unprecedented scale.</p>
 <p>Join our community of like-minded people, where collaboration is a cornerstone. We aim to achieve what was once deemed impossible and create a world driven by contributions, not capital. We aim to leave an indelible mark on the world.
 <p>Now is the time to be part of something truly daring. Step forward as a pioneer, and together, we will surpass expectations, and transform ownership. Dare to challenge the boundaries.</p>

<h1>Alternatives</h1>
 <p>If you are feeling overwhelmed by work, it is not a matter of working harder. That is what your boss tells you, and even your well-meaning co-workers. That is what every business book says, to search for excellence,  acquire new habits to move up, and do more with less effort. But it is not you, but the system that we call <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is designed to create more wealth for the owners and investors of the business you work for.</p>
 <p>The thing is that we created it, and we can create an alternative system, an alternative way of living.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Curing&rdquo; the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system would be never ending because the system is too easy to game, particularly by powerful people. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system adapts to fixes very fast.</p>
 <p>Beware that alternatives to <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> are fundamentally different and will feel alien, idealistic, and even crazy. It will take more courage than you can imagine.</p>

 <p>If you are not open to this and are just being polite (<span class='_quotespan'>Sounds interesting&hellip; tell me more about it</span>), you can stop reading now. Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>

<h1>What Does Fiat Even Mean?</h1>
 <p>You may not even know what the heck <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> means, but there is something, a feeling you have, that tells you that something is not quite right. And, you are correct in that it is not right, at all. Perhaps you are spending too much time at work. Or you are always ready to travel to a last-minute destination. Or maybe you have to do what would be three days&rsquo; worth of work in two, or one, hoping for an attaboy and maybe a reward. <span class='_quotespan'>Don't worry, you will get a chance to rest when you get back,</span> but the pile of work is bigger when you get back.</p>
 <p>Maybe you are fully aware of this or maybe you think that this is our destiny. But it is not &ldquo;our destiny,&rdquo; it is not living. It is the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system that we live in.</p>
 <p>We want to help you see <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> and how it is causing you the way you feel.</p>

<h1>Fiat, the Word</h1>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>But <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> it&rsquo;s a car.</span> And, indeed, FIAT is the name of an Italian automobile car manufacturer that stands for <em>Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino.</em> Thus the acronym.</p>
 <p>But what does <em>the word</em> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> mean?</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is an honest-to-goodness word that means <span class='_quotespan'>because I say so.</span> <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> money, for example, is worth what each nation says it is (plus or minus what investors will pay for it). Money used to be an equivalent to gold, but that stopped in the 70s. Now it is <span class='_quotespan'>because the country says so (and nominally its economy).</span>.</p>
 <p>In the context of giving orders, the phrase additionally carries an implied threat: <span class='_quotespan'>or else.</span></p>
 <p><span class='_quotespan'>Move those boxes from there to over there</span> (because I say so, &hellip; or else).</p>

<h1>The Fiat System</h1>
 <p>We live in a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> environment, or more accurately, a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <em>system</em>. Some people <em>do not</em> like the word <em>system</em> associated with their lives, and that is understandable. <span class='_quotespan'>My life is not limited by any system, I shape it however I want to.</span> However, whether you like it or not, you and I live within a system that has been evolving for quite a while.</p>
 <p>We created the system and we maintain it. You have a boss, within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. And within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, you work for a wage, but the wealth that you help create goes to the owner of the business you work for, not yourself. These are elements of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system that we created, we live in, and we uphold.</p>
 <p>Worse, the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system is based on,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Competition, not collaboration.</li>
   <li>Dividing people, not bringing them together</li>
   <li>Threats, fear, force, and pain.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system does not work for the poorest or the wealthiest.</p>
 <p>Luckily, there are alternatives to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system.</p>

<h1>It Starts with Rules</h1>
 <p>As we grow up, our parents teach us simple rules and they teach us how to follow them. They do that for our own good, because if you don&rsquo;t fit in society, you are going to be pushed to the edge. You are going to be an outcast relegated to the edge with other maladapted undesirables. When I was a kid, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; included people with Down Syndrome, men who left their hair long and women who cut it too short (unless it was a church thing). Anybody with an addiction or a tick were at the edge as well.</p>
 <p>Then, if we are lucky, we go to a pre-school. We have to unlearn some rules (<span class='_quotespan'>did you hit him back harder?</span>) and learn new ones (<span class='_quotespan'>keep your hands to yourself</span>).</p>
 <p>Lucky that we are, we go to primary school, where we learn more rules. We also start to learn the sanctioned view of the world. <span class='_quotespan'>That will be on the test!</span> In primary school, too, is when we start to put on the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses.</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <img
    src='/assets/img/pic-fiat-not-fiat-glassES.svg'
    width='70%'
    alt=''>
  </div>
 <p>If we happen to live in an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; country, we go to secondary school. By then the glasses are on all the time, we are simply fiddling with them and learning to make them more comfortable. No matter, we make sure that the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> lenses are never, ever off. We want to stay away from the people who don't know how to wear their glasses correctly.</p>
 <p>Finally, we go to work, with our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> glasses firmly on. We ask what the rules are and how to be a good worker.  We are happy to be a resource and happier that we are getting a steady wage (until, surprise, we are not).</p>
 <p>We learn to be kind and condescending to the ones whose glasses are skewed and not fitting correctly. <span class='_quotespan'>We do our best for these people, but they just don&rsquo;t want to learn the rules. They want to live on the edge.</span></p>
 
<h1>The Fiat System Is&hellip;</h1>
 <p>That is what <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <strong>system</strong> is,
  <ul>
   <li>Learning the rules,</li>
   <li>Following the rules,</li>
   <li>Enforcing the rules.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Think of what happens <em>when you get caught</em> not following the rules.<a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Think of how many decision you have made, now think of how you considered in the back of your head what your boss would think of them. Think of how many times you have said, <span class='_quotespan'>I am pretty sure that Bob is not going to like it!</span> You can&rsquo;t make a decision without considering Bob, your boss.</p>
 <p>You may be thinking, <span class='_quotespan'>How else would the system work? Things would not work without Bob.</span> That&rsquo;s part of what we learn as we grow up in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. It is Bob or chaos. You do what you do because of Bob, your boss.</p>
 </p>

<h1>Rules, Laws, and Force</h1>
 <p>Imagine a world where rules, initially upheld through conventions, eventually morph into cold, heartless <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> laws that leave us no choice but to comply. <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is a relentless force, bearing down on us with an iron grip.</p>
 <p>Picture this,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You  get a traffic ticket. A very minor form of force. You have to give up money (<eg>i.e.</eg>, coined force) to be spared the pain that would follow if you didn&rsquo;t.</li>
   <li>If you feel that is an injustice, you let it go to court (<eg>i.e.</eg>, another type of force).</li>
   <li>Victory brings celebration, the force is with you.</li>
   <li>If you are defeated, you are angry, but you have to pay the ticket. Still a minor force.</li>
   <li>On the other hand, if you happen to be from the <em>edge,</em> any sort of protest or disobedience may send you to prison.<a href='#en02'><sup id='bm02'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> This is no longer a minor force.</li>
   <li>Behind those cold, unforgiving walls a fight may break out and blood is spilled and lives are maimed or lost. Either way, it is definitely a <em>force majeure</em>.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Force is ever present in our <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. It goes from merely a frown to the ghastly specter of the electric chair.</p>
 <p>Withholding a reward because you did not say or did what was expected of you is a form of force. Getting passed over for a raise or promotion is a form of force. Firing you or laying you off is a form of force. Raising your rent so your only option is to leave is a form of force. We are surrounded by a system that runs on threats to actual pain (<eg>i.e.</eg>, force).</p>
 <p>Motivation is another form of force. <span class='_quotespan'>Do this and you&rsquo;ll get the reward.</span>  We often fail to see it for what it truly is—an external force, driving us toward someone else's desires. But you are being &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; to do what somebody else wants, regardless of what you may want to do. That is force.</p>
 <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>-base alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system there is no do-it-or-else force. The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> myth is that without force we would never do anything of significance, we would never do anything bigger than ourselves. They try to shatter our belief in our own capabilities, in our power of our collective potential.</p>
 <p>But I ask you to consider this: humanity has survived and thrived as a species. We birthed agriculture, spreading its roots across every corner of the planet. We managed to do all that and more without anybody dictating our path, without anyone wielding force to mold us.<p>
 <p>Then came the people who took things by force, because they had nothing to trade. And then came money, coinage which allowed them to trade the wealth that they extracted from you by force. And slowly by surely the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system took shape around us.</p>
 <p>Alongside, there came the stories that supported the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system as it evolved,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>An all powerful supernatural being at the top</li>
   <li>Paradise</li>
   <li>Eve as the bad apple</li>
   <li>Homosexuality and shellfish as abominations, pushed to the edge.</li>
   <li><span class='_quotespan'>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.</span><a href='#en03'><sup id='bm03'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></li>
  </ul>
 <p>Most insidious of all, we learn to expect that the fruit of our work should go to someone else. It goes to,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A god, an omnipotent being at the top</li>
   <li>A boss, an omnipotent being at the top.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>And that we get paid what the boss says is reasonable.</p>
 <p>It didn&rsquo;t start this way, but it evolved. First came prisoners of minor wars, that were made to carry whatever the winners didn&rsquo;t want to carry. At the end they either joined the winners (after all, they were related) or they went back to their village. Then came slavery, they kept you as a worthless worker because they had the force (and you were not related). Finally came wage work. From forced labor by sheer force to forced labor by coin. Different forms of force, but force throughout.</p>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> tendrils extend deep into every aspect of our lives, particularly in the realms of economics and politics. For example, &ldquo;being a good worker&rdquo; is a sign of pride today within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system you and I live in. Unwavering loyalty to their chosen politicians, no matter the cost. There is nothing strange about it, it is totally normal. The alternative, they say, is chaos to be avoided at all costs.</p>
 <p>Anybody talking about alternatives (you and I) must be crazy. Ignore them.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Organized religion has been part of the support system as well, but before we talk about that, we have to talk about divide-and-conquer.</p>

<h1>Countries and Other Divisions</h1>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>Countries are <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> creations, straight out of kingdoms that had been cleansed by force.</p>
  <p>For example, before Fernando and Isabel sent their minions to conquer the Americas, they waged their own cleansing campaign on their portion of the Iberian peninsula. Basques, Astures, Galicians, Catalonians, al-Andalucians, and others were forced to act as Catholics and speak Castilian (or else). The Inquisition stood as a merciless enforcer, ensuring obedience to the Church.</p>
  <p>By the time they got to the Americas, Fernando de Aragon and Isabel de Castilla had developed a methodology to cleanse whatever other cultures they encountered&mdash;a tool to subjugate, control, and obliterate anything that stood in their way,</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <table class='_h2table'>
     <tr>
      <th>Divide and Conquer</th>
      <td>
       <p>At some point women were made the property of men and were made subservient to them. That is, for example, why inherited last names are the man&rsquo;s. The <em>ez</em> at the end of Spanish family names is the equivalent to the possessive &ldquo;apostrophe s&rdquo; in English (<eg>i.e.</eg>, Pedro&rsquo;s) as it indicates that it &ldquo;belongs to&rdquo; to the men. <span class='_quotespan'>Men were the kings of their castle</span> and women were reduced to chattel. Sounds comical, but there is a intuitive logic to it: men now had to worry about staying in control of what belonged to them, and not about the injustices from the powerful men above.</p>
       <p>It all was bundled with a strong ideology that created an institution and, surprisingly enough, women became pillars of it. <span class='_quotespan'>Eve was the instigator of sin,</span> and must submit for salvation. Women covered their hair, wore burkas, and relinquished their autonomy in the name of duty and survival.</p>
       <p>As Christianity spread by force of colonization, non-Europeans were made subservient to Europeans. Of course, there were wealthy non-Europeans, close to their colonial masters, and poor non-Europeans. The wealthier were even put in charge.</p>
       <p>We are still struggling with that attitude today, thousands of years later. <span class='_quotespan'>We could be in paradise, but the woman enticed us to bite the apple of knowledge and poisoned us.</span> We are still struggling with the leftovers of colonization, domestic and foreign. We are on our way to bring it all out in the open and heal the wounds, but it is a struggle as powerful people cling to the past.</p>

  <h2>Radical</h2>
   <p>In a <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based alternative to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, there is no imposed hierarchy.

<h1>Capital and Contributions</h1>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> world we live in, the default is that the only way to contribute to a business is to invest capital in it. Said capital investment gives the investors power over the business. In the US investors don&rsquo;t have any power over company operations, but they can replace the CEO. And they can keep replacing him until they find one that runs the operations according to their wishes. Those are some of the side-effect of seeing capital as the only way to contribute.</p>
  <p>For one, power is force. So investors have power over the business.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, you have no ownership in the business. You are happy to get your salary, but that&rsquo;s that. Owners have power over you.</p>
 <h2>Radical</h2>
  <p>This is probably the most shocking thing about non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> alternatives: companies are not there to make founders and investors wealthy. Companies have to make money and be self-sustainable. But what usually goes into the pocket of the owners, now goes into the pockets of the co-owners, into the pockets of everybody who contributes to creating the wealth. If you are looking for yet another way to become wealthy, this ain&rsquo;t it. Companies are a way to increase the wellbeing of every co-owner and the society around them.</p>
  <p>Your level of co-ownership is determined by these contributions given to you by your co-owner peers. Your recognized contributions determine your level of co-ownership on a month to month basis. It is not static, it is dynamic. Next month it will most likely be different.</p>

      <th>But&hellip;</th>
      <td>
       <p>At this point you may be coming up with objections, <span class='_quotespan'>Yeah, but it can be easily gamed: I&rsquo;ll give you all my <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s and you give me all of yours.</span> And yes, it could, but only if the other co-owners do not say anything about. Because of &ldquo;Transparency,&rdquo; they can see all the transactions and it is up to the co-owners to say or do something. They can have a conversation with people who seem to be trying to game the process. If they do not change their behavior, co-owners can decide to not recognize any of their contributions because they are doing something that makes co-ownership a joke.</span></p>
       <p>Another objection might be that people won&rsquo;t want to take the time to recognize contributions. They may do it at first, but then they will stop. Again, the data is there for all to see and if all co-owners stop recognizing contributions, then they won&rsquo;t get any more co-ownership, including the take of the revenue. They may slow down until they see the result and then, I hope, they will go back to doing it. If not, the company will fall apart. On the way to a non-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> alternative things won&rsquo;t go perfect or smoothly. There will be plenty of bumps along the way. The &rdquo;fix,&ldquo; in my opinion, is not to elect a boss to tell us what to do; the &rdquo;fix&ldquo; is to deal with what you consider a problem&mdash;you are all co-owners.</p>
       <p>An objection that I heard more than once is that <em>other</em> people are coin operated. They do not want to do anything for a community of society. My usual retort is, <span class='_quotespan'>even your family?</span></p>
       <p>&ldquo;Homo economicus&rdquo; is one of those convenient stories that popped up to support the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. People are not coin operated, but people have to survive and will go to kinds of length to do it. The thing to observe is that survival, though necessary, is not living.</p>

       <p>The PRI is used to pay co-owners a <em>predictable, recurring income</em> (like a salary) when there is little or no revenue. The <span class='_paradigm'>PRI</span> is paid back by the revenue each co-owner gets given their <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s. Until it is paid in full, what a co-owner takes out of the <span class='_paradigm'>PRI</span> fund is a personal debt. Once the <span class='_paradigm'>PRI</span> fund is paid, the upside (dividends) that would normally go to the owners and investors goes to the co-owners according to their <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s.</p>

       <p>Indeed many do, and co-owners can do the same. I make a distinction between profits and dividends, and the latter is what is left after paying all expenses, <em>including any investments</em>. For example, if the co-owners want to buy a $5M building, they would put up a <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> to accumulate that amount. They could decide to commit enough into the <span class='_paradigm'>Banner</span> to build up to $5M in three years. That amount is not to be included in the dividends.</p>

<h1>Fiat and Radical</h1>
 <p><span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> is a complex and complicated system. <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> is a simple <span class='_paradigm'>Foundation</span></p>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>I have already said a lot about <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>. One thing I mentioned in passing is that <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> <strong>evolved</strong> into the complex mess it is today. For example, the Christian Bible admonished slaves to &ldquo;obey your earthly masters.&rdquo; However, when outright slavery went out the door, that stopped being acceptable language (though the majority of women and children to this day still have to obey their earthly masters).</p>
  <p>The thing that has remained constant in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> sysste, is <span class='_paradigm'>Force.</span></p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <img
     src='/assets/img/pic-fiat-fear-force-or-pain.svg'
     width='70%'
     alt=''>
   </div>
  <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model and its embedded force is at the root of all governance, from democracies to dictatorships. Can you think of a decentralized national government? I can&rsquo;t, either, because it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
 <h2>Radical</h2>
  <p>As opposed to <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span>, <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> is a <span class='_paradigm'>Foundation</span> of what we need at the root of the system, not an evolved system (<eg>i.e.</eg>, in yellow, below). <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> does not have embedded rules and it is not dogmatic in any way,</p>
   <div class='_center'>
    <img
     src='/assets/img/pic-the-radical-model-coming-together.svg'
     width='70%'
     alt=''>
   </div>
  <p>When looking for solutions to what we feel is wrong, we often get lost in the intellectual weeds and never discover what&rsquo;s really at the root of the problem. The <span class='_paradigm'>Radical Foundation</span> helps us remain clear,</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Will this decision make us more or less decentralized? Either choice is up to you and your community, but the <span class='_paradigm'>Foundation</span> helps you know which direction the decision is taking you.</li>
    <li>Will this decision make it easier to help people find meaning in what they are doing or not? Again, either choice is up to you and your community, but the <span class='_paradigm'>Foundation</span> helps you know where you are headed.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>You may be leaning one way, but rethink it once you realize where it would take you. What you definitely will not be able to do is hide behind, <span class='_quotespan'>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know!</span></p>
  <p><span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> doesn&rsquo;t come with rules out of the box, but you and the community of people you work with can come up with any rules you want, preferably without force. You are all co-owners.</p>

<h1>Competition and Collaboration</h1>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>Competition is another constant feature of the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model. We learn to compete from the minute we are born. Kindergarten slows it down a little, but it comes back in full force in everything that follows. We pretend to listen, but we are really waiting for our chance to outcompete the previous speakers. Sometimes we are aggressive and sometimes we are meek, but underneath it all we compete in the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. There are even debate clubs where we can practice our competitive skills.</p>
  <p>And, <span class='_quotespan'>so?</span> you ask, <span class='_quotespan'>what is wrong with that. We need to compete to survive.</span> But I see it as a way to divide people, as in divide and conquer. They who win and they who lose. In the Parliamentary system a specific political party may not win so they have to lump into coalitions and then proceed to the sausage-making room where they come up with &ldquo;Minister of this&rdquo; and &ldquo;Minister of that.&rdquo; This makes it a lot easier for the powerful to just pay off enough of the winners.</p>
  <p>Democracy-by-voting probably was the best system in the 18th centuryis, but we are in the 21<sup>st</sup> century now.</p>

 <h2>Radical</h2>
  <p>Competition  is a way of imposing your will. Cooperation is how you negotiate your will. Collaboration is the way to come up with what acceptable to (most) everyone. The people who can&rsquo;t live with it, have to come up with their own proposal. BTW, this is called <em>consent</em> by Sociocracy practitioners and as far as I know, they came up with it.</p>
  <p>We don&rsquo;t need to compete to survive. We need to compete to survive within the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system where artificial, made up scarcity is used as a tool of force. This is what Marx never figured out. He just wanted a system where the workers were at the top and powerful at the bottom. Stalin named himself the representative of all workers and the rest is history: worker at the top and everybody else at the bottom.</p>
  <p>Hitler used some of the same rhetoric and became friends with Stalin for a while. And then he made the mistake of going against the Russian winter.</p>

<h1>Scarcity and Abundance</h1>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>Food scarcity ended centuries ago, as soon as agriculture started to mix in with hunting and gathering. But then, agriculture brought in land scarcity. At least, that&rsquo;s how the story goes.</p>
  <p>Actually, what agriculture brought about was <em>land enclosures.</em> An enclosure is when somebody takes, <em>by force</em>, over land that was previously communal and provided for all. After the enclosure, if you want to use the land, you have to render goods.<a href='#en05'><sup id='bm05'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
  <p>Abundance for a few, scarcity for everybody else.</p>
  <p>Abundance brings out the forces to enclose, and that is going on today. For example, the newest abundant good is the so-called AI computing. It is abundant because it has evolved in the Open Source space (free as in beer). Some people would like to enclose that technology with regulation (force). People like Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX, Sam Altman, OpenAI, Kent Walker, SVP at Google, Mustafa Suleyman, Co-founder of DeepMind, Francesca Rossi, Global Leader at IBM Research are lobbying the US Congress for regulation that would amount to an enclosure.<a href='#en06'><sup id='bm06'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Abundance for a few, scarcity for everybody else, 21<sup>st</sup> century style.</p>
 <h2>Radical</h2>
  <p>Enclosures do come out of force and force is a no-no in <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>-based alternatives.</p>
  <p>We can&rsquo;t fix history, but we can choose our future. And we can choose a future where abundance is the rule, not the exception-until-somebody-figures-out-how-to-exploit-it.</p>
  <p>We can lead the way to such a future. It won&rsquo;t be easy and there will be many obstacles in the way. Many will come from inside us, what we have learned as the children-of-<span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> that we are.</p>
  <p>But we need to choose and then act to make it happen.</p>

<h1>rTools</h1>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>The only consistent &rdquo;tool&ldquo; in the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model is force.</p>
 <h2>Radical</h2>
  <p>These are some of the tools that have worked for us in our work with companies who are based on the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model. Some of these may go away, others will evolve, and others will come up in the future. I am presenting them here to inspire ideas, not dogma.</p>

 <p>This is not a certificate program or any such thing. The people who are part of it will tell you if the company is firmly based on the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> model or not. If they are afraid to tell you <span class='_quotespan'>because I may lose my job</span> or anything like it, then they are not really based on the <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> Foundation. If they think they are going in the right direction, then they are going in the right direction.</p>

 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>In a <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> business, things are static. You give me so much cash, and I&rsquo;ll give you so much of the company. That percentage of the business remains fixed forever. You can even die and your heirs get the piece of the business. They will try to dilute you, but if you stay on your tippy toes, you can fight it.</p>
 <h2>Radical</h2>
  <p>In a company based on <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span>, things are dynamic. You give me so much cash, negotiate a return, and you get your principal and the negotiated return in a negotiated timeframe. You contribute a lot this month and you end up with a serious percentage of all <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s and you get a serious percentage of the dividends. Next month you don&rsquo;t contribute as much and you end up with a smaller percentage of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s and a smaller percentage of dividends. Ownership is dynamic.</p>
  <div class='_center'>
   <table class='_h2table'>
    <tr>
     <th>What Are RADs?</th>
     <td>
      <p><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are like tokens. Not crypto tokens or any such nonsense. Your <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s really are a percentage of all <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s ever given. That is your percentage of whatever is distributed through them. Most often it is dividends. That is what remains of the revenue after paying all expenses, taxes, and any investments. This usually goes to the owners, but in <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> companies it goes to people who create the wealth, people like you, the co-owners.</p>
      <p>The number of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s you get for a given cycle (<eg>e.g.</eg>, one month) is calculated from the number of <span class='_paradigm'>Recognized Contributions</span>. These are your contributions that your peer co-owners have recognized as significant. They accumulate and at the end of the month the <em><span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s! Mobile App</em> calculates the number of <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s that each co-owner gets. They may be guidelines that your community has agreed to, but in the end it is whatever moves you to press the recognition button.</p>

         <p>R, the cleaning woman went by picking up the stuff people had left behind on their desks the day before. There were only a handful of people in the office at the time, including a young woman who looked really down.</p>
         <p>When she came back around she started talking to the young woman and our community. It was easy to listen in, so I did.</p>
         <p>It turned out that the young woman had a traumatic experience the night before. She had not slept much and decided to come to the office early instead of facing her walls. But here she was, facing the office walls. The conversation continued and went on for a while, but by the end the young woman said <span class='_quotespan'>Screw him. His loss.</span>.</p>

<h1>Pain vs Wellbeing</h1>
 <h2>Fiat</h2>
  <p>The <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> model is based on <span class='_paradigm'>Pain</span> and people have gotten used to avoiding pain and surviving.</p>
  <p>In the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system, a threat is usually enough,</p>

       <p>When we talk to people about going <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> at their company, many perceive an existential threat to managers. &ldquo;If you are getting rid of my job type, then you are getting rid of me.&rdquo;</p>
       <p>Ironically, managers can be the happiest abandoning their titles and becoming co-owners with their former employees. People who are today &ldquo;managers&rdquo; will benefit the most by going <span class='_paradigm'>Radical</span> because they are currently boxed up by the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> hierarchy.</p>

      <p>By the time Thomas Hobbes writes <em>Leviathan</em> the idea that people were a warring species was already completely normalized. Hobbes argued that humanity&rsquo;s natural state was a &ldquo;war of all against all.&ldquo;</p>

        <p>First, I jumped into the void, past my fears. I was hoping to go through it safely. Instead I came out stronger, with a positive view of life. It was a blind jump, but I discovered the light in my life.</p>
        <p>I am not split between my &ldquo;personal&rdquo; live and my &ldquo;work&rdquo; life. I am one and the same no matter what I am doing.</p>
        <p>I was surviving, not living. But now I can recognize the fears that held me in survival mode. I can go around them, lovingly, and go on with my life, guiding me, not my fears.</p>
        <p>I am still afraid, but I am living my life. The more I do it, the easier it gets. I am not afraid of dying, so I am not afraid of living.</p>
        <p>Nobody knows how to live my life better than myself. Nobody, besides me, knows what&rsquo;s best for me.</p>
