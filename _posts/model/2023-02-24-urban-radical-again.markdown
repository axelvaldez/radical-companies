 <p>An (imaginary) conversation with Tim Urban on blind spots.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>Below is an (imaginary) conversation with Tim Urban on blind spots. This ocurred to me after reading his book, <em>What&rsquo;s Ours Problem: A Self&ndash;Help Book for Society</em>,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> (in one sitting).</p>

<h1>Co&ndash;Management</h1>
 <div class="_quotespan">You have a blind spot.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">I have many&hellip;.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">&hellip; that may be, but you have one in particular that I know something about</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">That sounds like fundamentalism to me, but let&rsquo;s hear it.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">In any case, your blind spot is around &lsquo;jobs&rsquo; and &lsquo;top companies.&rsquo; You take them as a given, something you mention in passing, as the grass alongside the road. &lsquo;It is beautiful, ain&rsquo;t it. It&rsquo;s always been there. How can such a beautiful thing be part of the problem?.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">So, the grass is my blind spot?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">The &lsquo;jobs&rsquo; and &lsquo;top companies.&rsquo; are.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">How so?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Because a big part of the problems that you point out and are so passionate about <em>spring out</em> of what we call <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses, the source of &lsquo;jobs&rsquo; and &lsquo;top companies.&rsquo;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Very interesting. Go on.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">For example, you mentioned the case where professor Nancy Hopkins &lsquo;packed up her things and walked out of the talk&rsquo; that Larry Summers was giving as an Economist, not as Harvard president. You gave me the levers I have been looking for and I thank you for that, because it does take a long-term commitment to peel the layers off what we have grown up with and consider as the baseline of everything.</div></div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Thanks.<div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Your book rearrange things in mh head&hellip; no, it lifted the fog in my head and I thank you for that.<div>
 <div class="_quotespan">I am elated!<div>
 <div class="_quotespan">You make the distinction that Summers was invited to speak as an economist, not as Harvard president, but I think you know that it&rsquo;s difficult to separate the two. I think you also know that it is even more difficult for Summers to not let his beliefs influence his decisions as Harvard president, even assumig that he is exceptionally good at doing so.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">OK, I stopped smiling and I think I am ready to the blind spot.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">To restate it, your blind spot is that you don&rsquo;t see <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses as part of the problem that you so well illustrate. Even with your cartoon drawings, yes.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Thank you. I think.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">You have not even asked what <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses are?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">I think I know what that is. I had not thought of <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> as a label, but I do recognize putting labels on things that have beentofore been invisible. Besides, you are going to tell anyways.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Yes. I want to make sure we are starting from the same place. <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> means roeghly &lsquo;because I say so&rsquo;. So, what you call Social Justice Fundamentalists I might call Social Justine <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> mind-fuckers. Good, you are smiling again.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">It even is a nice smile and not a &lsquo;how stupid do you believe me to be?&rsquo; smile.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">In any case, we realized that the way businesses are organized is by <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span>. The owners control what goes on through their <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy. And the owners get that power over everything through their capital. The alternative RADICAL companies that we we are proposing, and actively making happen, are based on contributions. Wait&hellip; that was a jump&hellip; </div>
 <div class="_quotespan">That&rsquo;s OK. Labels are useful for illuminating distictions and calling some companies <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> created the space for other companies, in this case <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies. Nice.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Thank you. I will continue with my slow version of this story to make sure we don't off to different assumptions. For example, we always say <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> <em>business</em> and <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> <em>companies<em>.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">OK. Got it. Nice the full lables are <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> <em>business</em> and <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> <em>companies<em>. <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> <em>business</em> have been invisible, and that is correct. And, I assume that <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> <em>companies<em> don't exist but would be complementary to the arguments I put forward in <em>What&rsquo;s Our Problem</em>.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Bingo! The most dangerous thing about <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses is that they have been invisible. They also teach us that capital measn unquestionable power. Capital gives you absolute power over everything that goes on inside a business. And that why we call businesses dictatorships.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">I because you are from Cuba, you know about dictatorships.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">I thought I knew, but I know a lot more now thank to you. Your book as provided me with actionable knowledge. Silence is not just cowardly. In fact, that is not the despicable thing about silence: silence let the Fundamentalists amongst us gain strength. That is how dictatorships start, that is where they spring from. We keep silent to get along and in the blink of an eye, we <em>have to</em> keep silent to stay unhurt and alive.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Yes!</div>
 <div class="_quotespan"><span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses are silence training grounds. And <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> schools anbd homes, that learned from <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses. We self-train on being good citizens of democracies <em>based on dictatorships</em> known as <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">And they have been so succesful&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">&hellip; financially successful!&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Yes, but more that that. They have also been successful is sharing enouhg of their profits with a portion of society, who have become their <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> immunne system.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Shit. I could not have put that better if I tried.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">But you just did.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Yes, but no&hellip; whhatever. What did it for me was your use of &lsquo;silence&rsquo;. Maybe it was this diagram,</div>
