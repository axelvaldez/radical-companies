 <p>An (imaginary) conversation with Tim Urban on the impact his book had on me.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <div class="_quotespan">Out of love. That is making me unomfortable and energized at the same time. Weirder still, I feel like drawing.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">And speaking of drawing, I&rsquo;d like to tell what I found most impactful about the book using your drawings. OK?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Seems like you are going to do it anyways&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">The history of people illustrated as a 1,000-page book made me sit up and pay attention.</div>

 <div class="_quotespan">When I got to the ladder, I recognized the analysis and labeling that was coming and I got pretty excited. Then you came up with higher and primtive minds, genies and golems and&hellip; and&hellip; it was music to my ears. The high-rung and low-run quadrants were pure joy.</div>

 <div class="_quotespan"> I was aware of the distinction between what&rsquo;s inside your head and what is expressed and I knew that soken language was key. But it was a forehead-slaping moment when I saw this illustration and how communication makes it possible for the emergence of a higher level of being.</div>

 <div class="_quotespan">Towards the end of the book, this image jumped at me because it illustrates the biggest problem we face in moving forward,</div>
