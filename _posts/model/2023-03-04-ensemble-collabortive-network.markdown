<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Jose and I have been going back and forth between networks, collaboraties, and ensembles. I still prefer ensemble.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>What you have a co-owned company, ownership is determined by the amount of <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s that you have.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Then, when several co-owned companies realized that they want to get together to create particular thing. Maybe it is an electric car and one company can do the basic motor while another works on the mechanical engineering involved in putting together a chasis with synchronized motors, etc. Each company can see how their technology could be applied to other projects in the future. The projects are different enough that they want to remain independent. So, they form a &hellip; what?</p>
 <p>No matter what we call, what this means is that they want to temporarily pool their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s for the duration of the electric car project.</p>

<h1>Network</h1>
 <p>One suggestion is that we call this kind of association a network. Seems find, except that there is a whole body of network mathematics already in existance and naming it so would be consusing, at least.</p>

<h1>Collaborative</h1>
 <p>The other suggestion is we all them collaboratives, but I&rsquo;ve always resisted that term. Collaborative emphasizes the <em>labor</em> above everything else. But we want this temporary association to include everything, not just labor.</p>

<h1>Ensemble</h1>
 <p>Ensembles are groups of people who come togehter to play one or more particulary pieces of music. Making Music is a social act.</p>
 <p>What co-owned companies do together is a social act and it is very akin to making music. It is not just labor, but creativity, embracing mistakes, and making others look good.</p>
 <p>I think the association with music is preferable to the association with labor or mathematics.</p>
