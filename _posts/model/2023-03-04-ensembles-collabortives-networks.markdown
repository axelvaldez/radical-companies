<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Jose and I have been going back and forth between networks, collaboraties, and ensembles. This is the case for ensemble.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Several co-owned companies want to get together to create particular thing. It is not a merger or an acquisition or anythig like that. What this means for co-owned companies is that they want to pool their <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s for the duration of the project.</p>
 <p>Maybe it is an electric car and one company can do the basic motor while another works on the mechanical engineering involved in putting together a chasis with synchronized motors, etc. Each company can see how the technology they are passionate about could be applied to other projects in the future. They want to remain independent, ready to go their own way.</p>

<h1>Network</h1>
 <p>One suggestion is that we call this kind of association a network. Seems fine, except that there is a whole body of network mathematics already in existance and naming it so would be confusing, to say the least.</p>

<h1>Collaborative</h1>
 <p>The other suggestion is that we call them collaboratives. I have always resisted the team, because collaborative emphasizes the <em>labor</em>. But we want this (possibly) temporary association to include everything social, not just the labor component.</p>

<h1>Ensemble</h1>
 <p>Ensembles are groups of people who come togehter to play one or more particulary pieces of music. Making Music is a social act.</p>
 <p>Making an electric car is a social act and akin to making music. It includes creativity, embracing everybody&rsquo;s mistakes, and making others look good. The word comes comes from French, meaning <span class="_quotespan">together</span>. In Spanish, it translates to <em>conjunto</em> which means <em>close together</em>.
 <p>It seems that the associatin of <em>ensemble</em> with making music is more apt that associating it with <em>labor</em> or <em>mathematics</em>.</p>
