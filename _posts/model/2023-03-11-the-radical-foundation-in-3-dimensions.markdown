<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Yesterday we had a discussion about a way of reframing the <span class="_quotespan"><span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> model</span>. After having slept over it, my conclusion is that the <span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> model as is is a general thing around which many other <span class="_quotespan">framings</span> will be come up.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, I saw that rather than a list of works, the <span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> could be expressed as a three-dimensional picture, with Meaning and Belonging as the &lsquo;roof&rsquo; and Decentralization and Transparency as the &lsquo;floor.&rsquo; Experimentation is what holds the whole thing up.</p>
