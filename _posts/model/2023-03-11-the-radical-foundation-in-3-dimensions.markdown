 <p>Discomfort is good for you. Not pleasant, expecially at the moment, but good.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Yesterday we had a discussion about a way of reframing the <span class="_quotespan"><span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> model</span>. After having slept over it, my conclusion is that the <span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> model as is is a general thing around which many other <span class="_quotespan">framings</span> will be come up.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, after sleeping over it, I woke up with an image of a building where the words Meaning and Belonging formed a plane as the &lsquo;roof&rsquo; and Decentralization and Transparency form another plane as the &lsquo;floor,.&rsquo; and the words Experimentation holding up the roof.</p>

<h1>Explicit Alignment</h1>
 <p>Explicit Alignment goes <em>inside</em> each &ldquo;house.&rdquo;, as floors between the ground floor and to the roof.</p>
