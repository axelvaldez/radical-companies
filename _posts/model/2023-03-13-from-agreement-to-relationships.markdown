 <p>Contracts can be <em>enforced</em>, but when it comes to people relationships, we don&rsquo;t want to inject force. We want to make relationships as explicit as possible.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>You can read about the latest version of the Trust Agreement here.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Here, however, I am taking a different approach. Rather than creating an <em>agreement</em>, which is people can interpret as a contract, we are creating an Explicit Relationship.</p>

<h1>Not a Contract</h1>
 <p>Contracts can be <em>enforced</em>, but when it comes to people relationships, we don&rsquo;t want to inject force. Even if the force is wielded by a wise third party. We want to make relationships as explicit as possible.</p>
 <p>What is often lacking in the world is your explicit expression of yourself. Some of it comes out during discussions and arguments <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; that&rsquo;s the way I am. I cannot think any other way</span>. But most of it never gets said. Mind you, whatever you say about yourself is a snapshot of the way you feel at that moment on time. It is not the &lsquo;true you&rsquo; or anything like it. Whatever it is will change tomorrow or the day after. But it is a place to start,</p>
  <ol>
   <li>You</li>
   <li>Me</li>
   <li>Your commitments</li>
   <li>My commitments to your commitments</li>
  </ol>
 <p>Note that when doing this with a group, &lsquo;me&rsquo; is for each person in the group and &lsquo;my committments&rsquo; beocmes a list of each person&rsquo;s commitments.</p>

<h1>My & You</h1>
 <p>We do want to make explicit how you experience the world and what you have to offer it in return. Things that indicate how you show up in the wold,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Who are you?</li>
  <li>How do you show up?</li>
  <li>Why do you need others?</li>
  <li>What do you feel we need to agree on?</li>
  <li>What are your red lines?</li>
  <li>Anything else?</li>
  <li>What gets you angry?</li>
  <li>What shuts you up?</li>
  <li>What makes you excited?</li>
  <li>What we really need to know is what does each of the above look like?</li>
  <li>How would we know if you are angry, feel shut up, or excited?</li>
  <li>What are you biggest fears?</li>
  <li>Do you speak up? How?</li>
  <li>Do you need to be given permission to speak? <span class="_quotespan">You didn&rsquo;t ask me!</span></li>
 </ul>
 <p>Then the other, &lsquo;me,&rsquo; person deals talks about how they perceive the world and they show up in the world. If there is more than one person involved, they have probably gone through this before and their responses to these questions have beeb written down.</p>

<h1>Committments</h1>
 <p>As you go through these questions, you&rsquo;ll expose things that you would like to change. You turn those into committments, <span class="_quotespan">I will keep my voice down&hellip; .</span> That is question three above. Question four are the commitment that each other person is willing to make in regards to your commitment. <span class="_quotespan">I will ask you to keep your voice down, even if I have to raise my voice to get you to pay attention.</span></p>
 <p>After this is done, you go through the other co-owners&rsquo; commitments and add yours in regards to them.</p>
