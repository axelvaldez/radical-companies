<h1>Trust Agreement</h1>
 <p>A Trust Agreement is a guide to an exploration among would-be co-owners to make sure that they can get aligned and they want to work with each other. Even if this is a relative or somebody you know very well, don&rsquo;t skip doing the Trust Agreement. Maybe it turns out to be perfectly boring or you may discover surprises along the way.</p>

 <p>Also, please, take a look at our Foundation table and our Alignment table, particularly its <b>Impact</b> and <b>Purpose</b>.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>What thoughts does this bring up?</li>
   <li>Does it work for you?</li>
   <li>Does anything need to change or be clarified for you?</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Our recomendation is that you allot one hour each to Mindset, Transparency, and <b>Collaboration</b>. We have spend many more that three hours on these, and it has been very worth it. Doing it will get you to a level of trust with other co-owners that <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses don&rsquo;t ever get near. This practice creates a foundation for the relationships that are so important to our success.</p>
