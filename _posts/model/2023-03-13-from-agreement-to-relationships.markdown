<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Contracts can be <em>enforced</em>, but when it comes to relationships, we don&rsquo;t want to inject force. We want to make people and their relationships to be as explicit as possible.</p>
</div>


<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>You can read about the latest version of the Trust Agreement here.<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> However, in this post I am taking a different, simpler approach based on relationship.</p>

<h1>Not a Contract</h1>
 <p>Rather than creating an <em>agreement</em>, which people can interpret as a contract, we are creating an Explicit Relationships. Contracts can be <em>enforced</em> by the courts, but when it comes to relationships betweem people we don&rsquo;t want to inject force. Rather, we want to make relationships as explicit as possible.</p>
 <p>What is often lacking in the world is your explicit expression of yourself. Some of it comes out during arguments, <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; that&rsquo;s the way I am. I cannot think any other way</span>. But generally most of it never gets said.</p>
 <p>I know that whatever you say about yourself is a snapshot of the way you feel at this moment in time. It is not the &lsquo;true you&rsquo; for long: it will change tomorrow or the day after. But it is a place to start.</p>

<h1>Explict Relationships</h1>
 <p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple,</p>
  <ol>
   <li>You</li>
   <li>Me</li>
   <li>Your commitments</li>
   <li>My support commitments</li>
  </ol>
 <p>Note that when doing this with a group, &ldquo;me&rdquo; stands for each person in the group and &ldquo;my committments&rdquo; becomes a list of each person&rsquo;s commitments to each other.</p>

<h1>You & Me</h1>
 <p>We want to make explicit a) how you experience the world and b) what you have to offer it in return. We want to know how you show up in relathionships.</p>
 <p>These are in general the questions that you need to think</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Who are you?</li>
  <li>How do you show up?</li>
  <li>Why do you need others?</li>
  <li>What do you feel we need to agree on?</li>
  <li>What are your red lines?</li>
  <li>Anything else?</li>
  <li>What gets you angry?</li>
  <li>What shuts you up?</li>
  <li>What makes you excited?</li>
  <li>What are you biggest fears?</li>
  <li>How would we know if you are angry, feel shut up, or excited?</li>
  <li>Do you speak up?</li>
  <li>Do you need to be given permission to speak? <span class="_quotespan">You didn&rsquo;t ask me!</span></li>
  <li>Do you talk without pausing?</li>
  <li>How do we knew if we can interrrupt and jump in?</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Then the other, &lsquo;me,&rsquo; person deals talks about how they perceive the world and they show up in the world. If there is more than one person involved, they have probably gone through this before and their responses to these questions have beeb written down.</p>

<h1>Committments</h1>
 <p>As you go through these questions, you will likely bring up things that you would like to change. For some of these, you may even make a commitment, <span class="_quotespan">Even when I am agry, I will keep my voice down&hellip; .</span></p>
 <p>For each of those commitments, people in the group will make a committment to help you keep you on track to your commitment. <span class="_quotespan">I will ask you to keep your voice down, even if I have to raise my voice to get you to pay attention.</span></p>
 <p>After this is done, you go through the other co-owners&rsquo; commitments, made in their Explicit Relationships, and add your support commitment to them.</p>
