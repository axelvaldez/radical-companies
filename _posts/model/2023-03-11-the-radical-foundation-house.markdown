 <p>Discomfort is good for you. Not pleasant, expecially at the moment, but good.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Yesterday we had a discussion about a way of reframing the <span class="_quotespan"><span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> model</span>. After having slept over it, I woke up with an image of a building where,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The words MEANING and BELONGING are the two axis of the &ldquo;ground floor.&rdquo; It represents the people fundamentals and it is where everything starts,
    <div class="_center">
     <img
      style="width:70%; "
      src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-1.svg"
      alt="The floor of the Foundation house, it shows the words MEANING and BELONGING as its two axis.">
    </div>
   </li>
   <li>
    DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY are the axis of the &ldquo;roof&rdquo; meaning that the house has no boss in it and everything is transparent. The latter makes sure that any potential &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; of the system is apparent to everybody.
    <div class="_center">
     <img
      style="width:70%; "
      src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-2.svg"
      alt="The roof of the Foundation house, it shows the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY as its two axis.">
    </div>
   </li>
   <li>
    Finally, EXPERIMENTATION, underlying all practices, holds up the house. EXPERIMENTATION means that whether it worked as you expected (hypothesis) it or not, you always learn from any practice you put in place.
    <div class="_center">
     <img
      style="height:3.33in; "
      src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-3.svg"
      alt="The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between the floor and the roof and holds up the house.">
    </div>
   </li>
  </ul>

<h1>Altogether Now</h1>
 <p>Altogether, they make up the Foundation house, a template for non-<span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> systems, <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> being one of them,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <img
    style="width:70%; "
    src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-4.svg"
    alt="The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom. The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between them.">
  </div>

<h1>Explicit Alignment</h1>
 <p>Explicit Alignment goes <em>inside</em> each &ldquo;house,&rdquo; as floors between the ground floor and to the roof.</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   style="width:70%; "
   src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-5.svg"
   alt="The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom. The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between them. Also in between roof and floor, Explicit Alignment are the three floors between roof and floor.">
 </div>
  <ul>
   <li>There is one Impact. Changing the impact is major: it is the equivelent of making up a new company.</li>
   <li>There is one Purpose, although it may change (the gray color reresents a past floor).</li>
   <li>There are many Missions, one after another and many in parallel.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Everything else is a Practice,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s! mobile app</li>
   <li>Explicit Relationships</li>
   <li>etc.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Many Houses</h1>
 <p>What the uncomfortable discussion made me see is that there may be many houses, some of them based on the template <span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> house. We have no illusions of being the only model that will come up once people are able to see the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> model and the effect it has on their lives and on our world.</p>

<h1>The <span class="_paradigm">rCORE</span> House</h1>
 <p>For example, the <span class="_paradigm">rCORE</span> house could be like this,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   style="width:70%; "
   src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-7.svg"
   alt="The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top, the roof, and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom, the ground floor. The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between them. Between roof and floor, there are three floors labeled IMPACT, PURPOSE, and MISSION, as before, but this time with list of specific PRACTICES attached to each.">
 </div>

<h1>A Framing</h1>
 <p>This &ldquo;framing&rdquo; of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model may be appealing to &ldquo;build&rdquo; specific houses where what changes is the Practices.</p>
