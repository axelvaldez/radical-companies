 <p>Discomfort is good for you. Not pleasant, expecially at the moment, but good.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Yesterday we had a discussion about a way of reframing the <span class="_quotespan"><span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> model</span>. After having slept over it, I woke up with an image of a building where,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The words MEANING and BELONGING are the two axis of the &ldquo;ground floor.&rdquo; It represents the people fundamentals and it is where everything starts,
    <div style="floating:right; ">
     <img
      style="width:70%; "
      src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-1.svg"
      alt="The floor of the Foundation house, it shows the words MEANING and BELONGING as its two axis.">
    </div>
   </li>
   <li>
    DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY are the axis of the &ldquo;roof&rdquo; meaning that the house has no boss in it and everything is transparent. The latter makes sure that any &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; of the system is apparent to everybody.
    <div class="_center">
     <img
      style="width:70%; "
      src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-2.svg"
      alt="The roof of the Foundation house, it shows the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY as its two axis.">
    </div>
   </li>
   <li>
    Finally, the word EXPERIMENTATION holds up the house,
    <div class="_center">
     <img
      style="height:3.33in; "
      src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-3.svg"
      alt="The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between the floor and the roof and holds up the house.">
    </div>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <p>Altogether, they make up the Foundation house, a template for <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies,</p>
  <div class="_center">
   <img
    style="width:70%; "
    src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-4.svg"
    alt="The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom. The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between them.">
  </div>

<h1>Explicit Alignment</h1>
 <p>Explicit Alignment goes <em>inside</em> each &ldquo;house,&rdquo; as floors between the ground floor and to the roof.</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   style="width:70%; "
   src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-5.svg"
   alt="The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom. The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between them. Also in between roof and floor, Explicit Alignment are the three floors between roof and floor.">
 </div>
  <ul>
   <li>There is one Impact. Changing the impact is major: it is the equivelent of making up a new company.</li>
   <li>There is one Purpose, although it may change (the gray color reresents a past floor).</li>
   <li>There are many Missions, one after another and many in parallel.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Everything else is a Practice,</p>
  <ul>

   <li>Relationship Stories</li>
   <li>etc.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Many Houses</h1>
 <p>What the uncomfortable discussion made me see is that there may be many house based on the generic <span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> house.</p>
 <p>One such &ldquo;house&rdquo; was motivated by <span class="_paradigm">rCORE</span>,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   style="width:70%; "
   src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-6.svg"
   alt="The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom. The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between them. Between roof and floor, there are five floor labeled PEOPLE, IMPACT, TECHNOLOGY, FINANCIAL, and LEGAL.">
 </div>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">PEOPLE</span> seems to have elements of the roof in it. <span class="_paradigm">TECHNOLOGY</span>, <span class="_paradigm">FINANCIAL</span>, and <span class="_paradigm">LEGAL</span> are pratices that will change over time and as we gain experience with <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span>. But so be it, this is the kind of thing that we&rsquo;ll have to work through.</p>

<h1>The <span class="_paradigm">rCORE</span> House</h1>
 <p>Alternatively, the <span class="_paradigm">rCORE</span> house clould be like this,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   style="width:70%; "
   src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-7.svg"
   alt="The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top, the roff, and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom, the basemant floor. The word EXPERIMENTATION sits in between them. Between roof and floor, there are three floors labeled IMPACT, PURPOSE, and MISSION, as before, but this time with list of PRACTICES attached to each.">
 </div>
 <p>This &ldquo;framing&rdquo; of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model may be a more obvious &ldquo;structure&rdquo; to &ldquo;build&rdquo; specific houses where what changes is the Practices,</p>
