 <p>Discomfort is good for you. Not pleasant, expecially at the moment, but good.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Yesterday we had a discussion about a way of reframing the <span class="_quotespan"><span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> model</span>. After having slept over it, my conclusion is that the <span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> model as is is a general thing around which many other <span class="_quotespan">framings</span> will be come up.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, after sleeping over it, I woke up with an image of a building where the words Meaning and Belonging formed a plane as the &lsquo;roof&rsquo; and Decentralization and Transparency form another plane as the &lsquo;floor,.&rsquo; and the words Experimentation holding up the roof.</p>

<h1>Explicit Alignment</h1>
 <p>Explicit Alignment goes <em>inside</em> each &ldquo;house.&rdquo;, as floors between the ground floor and to the roof.</p>
 <div class="_center">

   alt="The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom. The word EXPERIEMENTAION sits in between them. Also in between roof and floor, Explicit Alignment are the three floors between roof and floor.">

  <ul>
   <li>There is one Impact.</li>
   <li>Although there is one Purpose at a time, it may change.</li>
   <li>There are many Missions, one after another and many in parallel.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Everything else is a Practice,</p>

<h1>Many Houses</h1>
 <p>What the uncomfortable discussion made me see is that there may be many house based on the generic <span class="_paradirm">RADICAL</span> house.</p>
 <p>One such &ldquo;house&rdquo; was motivated by <span class="_paradigm">rCORE</span>,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-3.svg"
   width="70%"
   alt="The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom. The word EXPERIEMENTAION sits in between them. Between roof and floor, there are five floor labeled PEOPLE, IMPACT, TECHNOLOGY, FINANCIAL, and LEGAL.">
 </div>
 <p><span class="_paradigm">PEOPLE</span> seems to have elements of the roof in it. <span class="_paradigm">TECHNOLOGY</span>, <span class="_paradigm">FINANCIAL</span>, and <span class="_paradigm">LEGAL</span> are pratices that will change over time and as we gain experience with <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span>. But so be it, this is the kind of thing that we&rsquo;ll have to work through.</p>

<h1>The <span class="_paradigm">rCORE</span> House</h1>
 <p>Alternatively, the <span class="_paradigm">rCORE</span> house clould be like this,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/pic-the-radical-foundation-house-4.svg"
   width="70%"
   alt="The words MEANING and BELONGING form a plane at the top, the roff, and the words DECENTRALIZATION and TRANSPARENCY form a plane at the bottom, the basemant floor. The word EXPERIEMENTAION sits in between them. Between roof and floor, there are three floors labeled IMPACT, PURPOSE, and MISSION, as before, but this time with list of PRACTICES attached to each.">
 </div>
 <p>This &ldquo;framing&rdquo; of the <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> model may be a more obvious &ldquo;structure&rdquo; to &ldquo;build&rdquo; specific houses where what changes is the Practices,</p>
