<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Where did this forest come from?</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>We’d have to understand the forest well enough before somebody can ask, “<em>Where did this forest come from?</em>”</p>
 <p>The forest comes from  the relationship between,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>A seed ready to grow, and</li>
  <li>Land that’s ready to feed it</li>
 </ul>
