 <p>An (imaginary) conversation with Tim Urban on co&ndash;management and co&ndash;ownership.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>Below is an (imaginary) conversation with Tim Urban on co&ndash;management and co&ndash;ownership. This ocurred to me after reading his book, <em>What&rsquo;s Ours Problem: A Self&ndash;Help Book for Society</em>,<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> (in one sitting).</p>

<h1>Co&ndash;Management</h1>
 <div class="_quotespan">What do you know about co&ndash;management?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">What is it?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Co&ndash;management is pretty much what people call self&ndash;management today. We call it co&ndash;management because it refers to the work we do together. The corporation doesn&rsquo;t manage it<em>self</em>, people co&ndash;manage it.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">OK, got it.</div>

<h1>Co&ndash;Ownership</h1>
 <div class="_quotespan">Do you want me to explain co&ndash;ownership?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">I think I know, but to make sure, tell me.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Well, instead of it being own by investors based on their capital, it is own by everybody who work at making it grow, based on the recognized contributions.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">That&rsquo;s very interesting. But, does it work? How?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">There is an app for that&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">That is so 2019&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">But <span style="font-style:normal; ">there is</span>. The app lets every co&ndash;owner recognize the contributioins of other co&ndash;owners.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">So, you don&rsquo;t need a manager for that!</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">We call them bosses. Anybody who has power over anybody else as a matter of their <span style="font-style:normal; ">given</span> title, we call them bosses.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">OK. OK. So, I recognize your contributions&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">&hellip; and other people recognize my contributions, too.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Right, I get it, but Where I was heading with that is that, OK, I recognize your contributions, but so what?</div>

<h1><span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s</h1>
 <div class="_quotespan">OK, then, to continue&hellip; every co&ndash;owner gets one <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span> per day&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">&hellip; RAD? For <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span></div>
 <div class="_quotespan">You are smiling, but We could not come up with another name&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">OK, some unit. Like Green Stamps.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">How&hellip; How do you know about those?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">My mom had an album which she got from her dad. She said they gave them out at stores and you traded them for trinkets and stuff.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Yes, they did. Getting back to RADs, you get one per day&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Why?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Because you exist every day and your existance contributes to the creation and growth of things, wether you are <span style="font-style:normal; ">[air quotes]</span> &lsquo;working&rsquo; or not.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">OK, go on.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">You get one RAD per day&hellip; and at the end of, say, a monthly cycle, the app figures what percentage of your recognized contribution each co&ndash;owner got and gives each person that percentage of RADs. Later the RADs determine how much revenue money you get, for example.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">So you don&rsquo;t get to keep the <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s! You give them to the other co&ndash;owners, right?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Nope. Right.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">What are the rules? What&rsquo;s a legit recognized contribution?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">There are no rules. Or put another way, you make up your own rules. You can share yours, but people can always make up their own.</div>

<h1>Transparency</h1>
 <div class="_quotespan">OK. Wait. OK. But that is ripe for cheat&hellip; WAIT&hellip; are these grants transparent? can everybody see what is going on. I mean, there is no boss, right&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Right, they are transparent to the co&ndash;owners and to the world.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Holy shit!</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">That is by far the cleverest thing we came up with, by the way.</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Holy shit! That means that any <span style="font-style:normal; ">[exagerated air quotes]</span> &lsquo;cheating&rsquo; will be caught by the co&ndash;&hellip;co&ndash;owners, is that what you call them?</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Yes. And also by the app&rsquo;s backend itself. It can constantly look for and flag irregularities. In the end, it is up to people to resolve the issue, if there is one. I&rsquo;d have to say, you got this quickly&hellip;</div>
 <div class="_quotespan">Look, I spend six years thinking about all kind of things related to this kind of stuff, so this is not quite unexpected.</div>
