<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Shares are not <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>When the <span class='_paradigm'>FIAT</span> owner gives another investor 10% of the business in shares, that is forever. For example, Mark Zuckerberg owns 11% of Meta, forever. He can retire from the business now and he will still own 11% of Meta.</p>

<h1>Shares Are Static, <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s Are Dynamic</h1>
 <p>When co-owners give another co-owner 10% of the given <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s, that lasts for a month. Next month the same co-owner may end up with 5% and the next with 20%. It depends on his contributions as recognized by other co-owners.</p>
 <p>Bottom line, <span class='_paradigm'>RAD</span>s are not shares.</p>
 <p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
