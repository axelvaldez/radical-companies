 <p>Late last night I read the latest Corporate Rebel post and in it Pim de Morre<a href='#en01'><sup id='bm01'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> announced that he was reading <em>Escape from Freedom</em><a href='#en02'><sup id='bm02'>&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a>.</p>
 <p>I have been thinking where the inspiration for Radical had come from and this may be an important link in the chain because I read this book in 1969-70 when I was 18-19 years old (I am 73 now).</p>
 <p>In it Pim says the he talks about <em>Escape from Freedom</em> and <em>Embrace Freedom</em>. I'll find down more detail tomorrow when I start to read it again (50 years later). I have probably consciously forgotten most of it, but the lessons became part of me.</p>
