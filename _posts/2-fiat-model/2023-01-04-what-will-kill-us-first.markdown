<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>Which will destroy the Anthropocene<a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> first, climate change or more of the same?</p>

<h1>Climate Change</h1>
 <p>First, take climate change,</p>
 <ul> 
  <li>Changes to temperature patterns change weather patterns.</li>
  <li>Changes to weather patterns change agricultural and wild species habitats.</li>
  <li>Changes to agriculture and wild species habitats are a threat to our life support system and infrastructure will be disrupted.</li>
  <li>As our life support system declines and infrastructure is disrupted, our population will decline.</li>
  <li>Given our <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> mindset, there is a good chance that competition will increase and our cultural accomplishments will be forgotten.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The other thing that has been happening for a while is the trend towards homogeneity in many fields.</p>

<h1>Homogeneity in Politics</h1>
 <p>This move towards homogeneity is not &ldquo;coming&rdquo;, it is already happening. Take governance, for example.</p>
 <p>As every nation moves towards being run like every other nation, experimentation goes down and nations approach an all powerful, forever state. Today we can still compare the US to Europe when it comes to, say, healthcare. But as homogeneity sets in, distinctions will be minimal and easily brushed off.</p>

<h1>Decline of Science</h1>
 <p>For another example, take the decline of disruptive science,</p>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>The number of science and technology research papers published has skyrocketed over the past few decades &ndash; but the &lsquo;disruptiveness&rsquo; of those papers has dropped. &hellip;</p>
  <p>Data from millions of manuscripts show that, compared with the mid-twentieth century, research done in the 2000s was much more likely to incrementally push science into incremental improvements rather than to veer off in a new direction and render previous work obsolete. Analysis of patents from 1976 to 2010 showed the same trend.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 </div>
 <p>This is happening in social science, technology, physical sciences, life sciences, and biomedicine.</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img

   width="100%"
   alt="">
 </div>
 <p>In sheer numbers, there is more research, but it is towards  provements (<span class='_quotespan'>Wow, that is going to make us my skin smoother!</span>), and mot towards discoveries (<span class='_quotespan'>WHAT? We can generate energy like the Sun does?</span>).</p>

<h1>Fragile Food</h1>
 <p>Another example comes from our food supply: food production is getting more and more fragile as we consume fewer and fewer food varieties.<a href="#en03"><sup id="bm03">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
 <div class="_citation">
  <p>&ldquo;The ways in which plants are used by societies around the world have narrowed drastically over the past 500 years.&rdquo;<a href="#en04"><sup id="bm04">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Crop growers worldwide face enormous challenges. Plants are becoming less resistant to pests and diseases. Crops are more likely to be damaged or fail because of droughts, heatwaves, floods, salinization and rising sea levels. Soils are degraded; rivers and watersheds are polluted; and the diversity and abundance of crop pollinators are in steep decline.&rdquo;</p>
 </div>

<h1>It Has Happened Before</h1>
 <p>In <em>Profit: An Environmental History</em><a href="#en11"><sup id="bm11">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> Mark Stoll documents, extensively, how competition has driven us to the spoilage of our environment multiple times. The process was not good for most people who went to their early grave from overwork, malnutrition, and disease. Forests were devastated by sugar, tobacco, and other &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; crops. Over time they drained the land of nutrients and impoverished people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
 <p>This is not the first time that competition has driven us to collapse, but it has been localized. The big problem now is that the specter of collapse is global. In fact, it won&rsquo;t be a collapse, as much as a near extinction. By near I mean that there will be enough of us left and we will eventually make a come back. The winner-takes-all <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system of competition and dominance has been catastrophic and it would force us to replay the same old movie that ends up in collapse, again.</p>
 <p>We need to try a different system, one based on collaboration, not competition. Abundance, not scarcity. co-management and co-ownership, not masters and slaves.</p>

<h1>Strong Trend</h1>
 <p>Politically, our priorities are trending towards tweaking and avoiding risk. Worst, this trend is bringing about a world-wide monoculture in every aspect of our lives, not only in politics,<a href="#en05"><sup id="bm05">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> but also science, food, etc.</p>

<h1>Monoculture</h1>
 <p>Monocultures are fragile. A virus that harm one member of the species, is capable of harming <em>every</em> member of the species.</p>
 <p>Nature fends this off via genetic and habitat variations. This will allow a handful of individuals to survive, though some cultural knowledge will vanish.</p>
 <p>Non-human species don&rsquo;t accumulate as much cultural knowledge, but humans accumulate a lot of it. We will lose much, if not most, of it.</p>
 <p>We will most likely get a chance to restart, but with a decimated community. The whole thing will be very fragile as we restart from near-scratch.</p>

<h1>The Anthropocene</h1>
 <p>This will happen to us, and the Anthropocene will end if we don&rsquo;t do something about the direction we are going. Our garsoline car is heading towards world-wide homogeneity and climate change.</p>

<h1>RADICAL Mindset</h1>
 <p>One way to protect us against this is a mindset of co-management and co-ownership. If we manage to spread it widely, then we will have a chance to not end up in the same place we are today, with competition rampant, and domination as the only humanity-wide <em>Umwelt</em>.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
 <p>The RADICAL model consists of the RADICAL foundation, its tools, and new skills.</p>

 <h1>The RADICAL Foundation</h1>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_h2table">
   <tr>
    <th>people</th>
    <td>Meaning & Belonging</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>commitments</th>
    <td>Decentralization & Transparency</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>practices</th>
    <td>Experimentation</td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </div>
 
 <h1>The Tools</h1>
  <p>These are the tools that we have come with so far,</p>
   <div class="_center">
    <table class="_h2table">
     <tr>
      <th>Explicit<br>Alignment</th>
      <td>
       <p>This applies to a group of people working on a common project (<em>e.g.</em>, a company). However you choose to express them, these are the key components that you must consider.</p>
       <p>The adjetive &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; comes from the fact that 1) it means what it says, and 2) it is public.</p>
       <p>&ldquo;Alignment&rdquo; means that we are all in agreement with it (not that you have to wear a blue tie). The alignment comes from serveral discussions, not from a &ldquo;boss.&rdquo;</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>

        </div>
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <th>Explicit Relationship</th>
      <td>
       <p>Inspired by J Kim Wright&rsquo;s Concious Contracts&reg;, these apply to <em>individuals</em> as they create or enter a <em>community</em>. Its goal is to make explicit that which usually remains hidden for fear of being ridiculed or rejected. It is the start of trust building in a safe pace (psychologically and physically).</p>
       <p>The point is to let others know areas that you want to improve abd could use need help.</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <th>Future Tools</th>
      <td>
       <p>There are going to be more tools in the future. For example, specialized and community-specific tools.</p>
       <p>Stay tuned.</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
    </table>
   </div>

 <h1>The Skills</h1>
  <p>Skills include the capacity to,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Be inquisitive over being accusative</li>
   <li>Be playful over being rigid</li>
   <li>Speaking from love over a dominating lecture.</li>
  </ul>
