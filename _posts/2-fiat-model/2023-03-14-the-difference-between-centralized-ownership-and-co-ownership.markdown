<div style="display:none;">
 <p>Centralized ownership will kill us. Decentralized ownership is beautiful. It is about centralized versus decentralized, not ownership.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>At one point I wrote,</p>
  <div class="_citation">&nbsp;&hellip; centralized governance and ownership will destroy us. A lot of folks seem to agree that we have to decentralize decision making (co-management); we also have to decentralize ownership (co-ownership). We have to let wealth flow to the people who created it. We need co-ownership in addition to co-management.</div>
 <p>It is confusing and not as clear as it needs to be. I have this thing about using the fewest words possible to say things, but sometimes I go way over and this is one case where I did.</p>
 <p>This is the corrections I made,</p>
  <ul>
   <li><span class="_quotespan">&hellip; <span class="_me">centralized</span> governance and ownership will destroy us.</span> &ndash; Emphasis on <span class="_quotespan">centralized.</span></li>
   <li><span class="_quotespan">Many folks seem to agree that we have to decentralize decision making, but that is not enough. We also have to decentralize ownership.</span></li>
   <li>I also changed <span class="_quotespan">I hope</span> because is not the same as <span class="_quotespan">I know.</span></li>
   <li>Also, I took out &ldquo;(co-management)&rdquo; and &ldquo;(co-ownership)&rdquo; to avoid confusion.</li>
   <li><span class="_quotespan">We have to let wealth flow to the people who created it, <span class="_me">based on their contributions</span>.</span> &ndash; The bit about &ldquo;based on their contributions&rdquo; is very important.</li>
   <li><span class="_quotespan">We must move towards co-ownership as well as to co-management.</span> &ndash; Changed it for clarity.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>This is what I meant to write,</p>
  <div class="_citation">&hellip; <span class="_me">centralized</span> governance and ownership will destroy us. Many folks seem to agree that we have to decentralize decision making, but that is not enough. We also have to decentralize ownership. We have to let wealth flow to the people who created it, based on their contributions. Instead, we must move towards co-ownership (<em>i.e.</em>, decentralized ownership) as well as to co-management (<em>i.e.</em>, decentralized management).</div>.
