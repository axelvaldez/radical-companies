 <p>Capital versus force, that is of the things that Karl Mark is remembered for. A distinction without a difference. Capital to buy force, versus the proletariatâ€™s sacrificial force.</p>

<h1>Capital Is Force</h1>
 <p>Capital versus force, that is of the things that Karl Mark is remembered for: capital to buy force, versus the proletariat&rsquo;s sacrificial force.</p>
 <p>A distinction without a difference.</p>
 <p>Capitalists won&rsquo;t have their way anymore based on their capital. A New Man, emancipated from egotism, will rise and will run the (same) <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> system on behalf of the proletariat.</p>
 <div class="_speakera">First, the proletariat will take the capitalist down by <em>force</em>. Then they will use the riches they capture to create a system that is fair to the proletariat.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">Good. And how will this fair-to-all situation come about?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">Well, we will figure that out as we go. In the meantime, we will hold the capital on behalf of the proletariat.</div>
 <div class="_speakerb">So you will take over everything and decide what to do with it al later, right?</div>
 <div class="_speakera">On behalf of the proletariat, yes!</div>
 
<h1>We Can&rsquo;t See It</h1>
 <p>Karl Marx was blind to the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system. He just switched the owners, from capitalist to &rdquo;the new man.&rdquo; Unfortunately, he kept the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system itself but he could not see it. The important thing is to make the <span class='_paradigm'>Fiat</span> system <em>visible</em> and how it hurts all of us.</p>
 <p>Having alternatives is a very high in priority for our existence.</p>
