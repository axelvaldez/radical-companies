<h1>The Weakness: Owner-Boss</h1>
 <p>Co-management is a move away from the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> hierarchy, and that&rsquo;s good. But it doesn&rsquo;t last: we must have decentralized ownership, which we call co-ownership, for robust and stable governance.</p>
 <p>In a recent Corporate Rebels post, Joost Minnaar identifies ten <em>progressive organizational structures</em><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a> which he calls Amoebas, Cells, Circles, Chains, Fractals, Honeycombs, Lattice, Micro-communities, Mini-factories, and Squads.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, except for WL Gore, all the organizations given as primary examples have an owner-boss at the top. In these cases, the owner-boss sees himself as a “servant leader” or some other benevolent &rdquo;benevolent&rdquo; crap.</p>

<h1>Co-Ownership Brings Robustness</h1>
 <p>It is great, in fact, that these companies have experimented with co-management. They have shown that it works and that we don&rsquo;t need the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> hierarchical system we live under. Unfortunately, co-management is not enough because it doesn&rsquo;t last.</p>
 <p>Most of these &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; companies have fallen back to the <span class="_paradigm">Fiat</span> hierarchical model once the benevolent owner-boss.is out of the picture.</p>
 <p>For governance to be decentralized in robust and long-term way, decentralized management must be accompanied by decentralized ownership or co-ownership, as we call it.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">&hairsp;&nabla;&hairsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>Robustness Emerges from a Simple Foundation</h1>
 <p>Rather than specific practices or strict methodologies, this foundation allows you to discover out what works for you, while helping you to keep grounded on what&rsquo;s important,</p>

    <tr>
     <th>Meaning and Belonging</th>
     <td>
      <p>These are important things to people, finding meaning in what they do and belongin to a community that helps them.</p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Decentralization & Transparency</th>
     <td>
      <p>I tried, but I didn't find a way to reduce it to one word. You need both. Decntralization and transparency specify a range, they are vectors. You can be mvoe towards more or less decentralizationh and more or less transparent dependind on choices you make, decision you take.</p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Experimentation</th>
     <td>
      <p>Finally, experiment. Be explicit about what you expect (<em>e.g.</em>, tomato paste with 50% acidity) and then don&rsquo;t be afraid of experimenting. If your results match your expectations, call it an innovation and celebrate. Otherwise, learn from it.</p>
