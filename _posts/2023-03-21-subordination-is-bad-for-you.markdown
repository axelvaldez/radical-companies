  <span class="_citation">Subordination leads to traits associated with depression.</span>
  and
  <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; when individuals are repeatedly exposed to an inescapable aversive situation, they lose the capacity to escape from other, avoidable aversive situations &ndash; a pattern of behaviour known as learned helplessness</span>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>To be fair, this has been tested in laboratory rats, not people. However, <span class="_quotespan">This propensity seems to be evolutionarily conserved.</span> which means that there is a high likelyhood that it applies to us, too, and subordination is bad for us. Not only it may lead to depression, it induces learned helplessness or as we call it in the vernacular, self-victimization. People who are constantly defeated, learned that they are loses.</p>
 <p>And here is a claim: as opposed to rates, we get over being a loser and exert our drive to win, at all costs. We explode and head for ruthless. Mind you, we have learned to do it nicely, and be polite, but we are going to do what we have to do to win. And if it hurts others in the process, so be it.</p>
 <p>Speaking for myself, you don&rsquo;t even see the hurt that you bring to others, because they&rsquo;ve learned to be submissive and to signal that, <span class="_quotespan">hey, I am not standing in your way.</span> My own reactions when I went for the win-at-all-costs always was along the lines of, <span class="_quotespan">I have a good team, that understands and backs me.</span> Of course, the subordinates can live with this kind of thing by not recounting it as a loss for them, but as a win for the team.</p>

<h1>People Are&hellip;</h1>
 <p>
   Whenever I hear others start a sentence with,
   <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; but people are&hellip;</span>
   I think,
   <span class="_quotespan">yes, that&rsquo;s the way people are <em>under the
   <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system</em></span>.
   In other words, it is not &ldquo;in our nature&rdquo; to be submissive, but we are quite prepared to do so.
   <em>Any of us</em>
   are prepared to do so.
