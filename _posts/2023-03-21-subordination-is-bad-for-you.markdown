   <span class="_quotespan">Subordination leads to traits associated with depression.</span>
   and
   <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; when individuals are repeatedly exposed to an inescapable aversive situation, they lose the capacity to escape from other, avoidable aversive situations &ndash; a pattern of behaviour known as learned helplessness</span>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>To be fair, this has been tested in laboratory rats, not people. However, <span class="_quotespan">This propensity seems to be evolutionarily conserved.</span> which means that there is a high likelyhood that it applies to us, too, and subordination is bad for us. Not only it may lead to depression, it induces learned helplessness. The <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> hierarchy is an "inescapable aversive situation" for people, even the ones who are part of the hierarchy itself. They are constantly defeated and learn to be losers.</p>
 <p>And here is my claim: as opposed to rats, we get over being a loser and exert our drive to win-at-all-costs. We explode and head for ruthlessness if need be. Mind you, we have learned to do it nicely, and be polite, and all that, but we are going to do what we have to do to win. And if it hurts others in the process, so be it.</p>
 <p>Speaking for myself, I didn&rsquo;t even see the hurt that I caused to others because they&rsquo;ve learned to signal that, <span class="_quotespan">hey, I am not standing in your way.</span> Of course, my own reactions wnet along the lines of, <span class="_quotespan">I have a good team&mdash;they understands and back me.</span></p>
 <p>The subordinates can live with this kind of thing by telling themselves that it was a win for the team, though in reality it was a win for me.</p>

<h1>People Are&hellip;</h1>
 <p>
   Whenever I hear others start a sentence with,
   <span class="_quotespan">&hellip; but people are&hellip;</span>
   I think,
   <span class="_quotespan">yes, that&rsquo;s the way people are <em>under the
   <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> system</em></span>.
   In other words, it is not &ldquo;in our nature&rdquo; to be submissive, but we are quite prepared to do so.
   <em>Any of us</em>
   are prepared to do so.
