<h1>Good News, Bad News</h1>
 <p>On the positive side,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You have a great idea</li>
   <li>The idea is neutral or good for the Earth-as-life-support.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>On the other hand,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You don&rsquo;t have capital.</li>
   <li>Your friends are busy with their own jobs.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>The Foundation</h1>
 <p>Listen to the Forc&hellip; er&hellip; the Foundation,</p>

  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>Transparency: Talk about your idea to as many people as you can <em>anywhere in the wold</em>. This will help you mold your idea. If felt great when you first thought of it, but it now has to be shaped, so lean on your social circle to help you do it.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Decentralization: Talk to people but, they either won&rsquo;t get it or they will and be repelled by it. With all the talk about &ldquo;teal&rdquo; and the like, people will likely recognize co-management; they may even be enthusiastic about it. On the other hand, when you talk about co-ownership you may get a neutral stare or curiosity, but be ready for disgust or an ever-so-polite ridicule. They are not attacking you as much as they are trying to push out the thought you just put in their head.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Meaning & Belonging: if you identify people who are really interested in this, hold on to them. If they have skills that will help create your idea and you want them in your team, lucky you, go to the next step.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Experiment: Try variations on the theme at different times, then remember the ones that work.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

<h1>Borrowing, or Not</h1>
 <p>If you want to, borrow capital. &ldquo;Seed capital&rdquo; comes from friends, family, and fools. Friends and family know you and trust you; fools believe in you. They all want you to succeed.</p>
 <p>Seed capital is formalized as a legal Note that promises them, 1) their money back plus some up upsid, or 2) shares of the new company. But you new company <em>won&rsquo;t have shares</em>, so Notes are not applicable.</p>
 <p>Instead treat it like a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investment. Figure out 1) an upside to be paid 2) over a period of time. Twenty percent over two years, or double after five, or &hellip; whatever!</p>
 <p>This capital will fund two things: 1) whatever you have to buy, and 2) the PRI fund.</p>
 <p>If you don not want to borrow capital, then there won't have a PRI fund and you will need to find people who can afford to wait for revenue.</p>
 
<h1>Hiring</h1>
 <p>You are not going to do any hiring, you are finding co-owners. You should repeat this, out loud, many times. Like a mantra.</p>
 <p>Since you are not hiring, you are not going to interview people. One way to not fall for into the interview habit is to tell the person you are talking to that 1) you are looking for co-owners, 2) this is not an interview, and to 3) please, let me know when this starts to feel like one.</p>
 <p>What you are going to do is to explain that PRI fund and then do a Trust Agreement.

 <p>Do a Trust Agreement with the first co-owner in your team,</p>
