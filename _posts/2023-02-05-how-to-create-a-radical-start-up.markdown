 <p>You have a great idea which is neutral or good for the Earth-as-life-support. On the other hand, you don&rsquo;t have capital and your friends are busy with their own jobs.</p>

<h1>Good News, Bad News</h1>
 <p>On the positive side,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You have a great idea</li>
   <li>The idea is neutral or good for the Earth-as-life-support.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>On the other hand,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You don&rsquo;t have capital.</li>
   <li>Your friends are busy with their own jobs.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>The Foundation</h1>

  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>Transparency: Talk about your idea to as many people as you can <em>anywhere in the wold</em>. This will help you mold your idea. If felt great when you first thought of it, but it now has to be shaped, so lean on your social circle to help you do it.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Decentralization: Talk to people but, they either won&rsquo;t get it or they will and be repelled by it. With all the talk about &ldquo;teal&rdquo; and the like, people will likely recognize co-management; they may even be enthusiastic about it. On the other hand, when you talk about co-ownership you may get a neutral stare or curiosity, but be ready for disgust or an ever-so-polite ridicule. They are not attacking you as much as they are trying to push out the thought you just put in their head.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Meaning & Belonging: if you identify people who are really interested in this, hold on to them. If they have skills that will help create your idea and you want them in your team, lucky you, go to the next step.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Experiment: Try variations on the theme at different times, then remember the ones that work.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

<h1>Borrowing, or Not</h1>
 <p>If you want to, borrow capital. &ldquo;Seed capital&rdquo; comes from friends, family, and fools. Friends and family know you and trust you; fools believe in you. They all want you to succeed.</p>
 <p>Seed capital is formalized as a legal Note that promises them, 1) their money back plus some up upside, or 2) shares of the new company. But you new company <em>won&rsquo;t have shares</em>, so Notes are not applicable.</p>
 <p>Instead treat borrowed capital like a <span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> investment which includes an upside to be paid on top of the principal over a period of time. 120% over two years, or double after five, or &hellip; whatever you think is realistic and reasonable. Explain that this does not include any other powers. This won&rsquo;t be a surprise for the friends/family/fools crowd. It will most likely be a surprise, perhaps unacceptable, to traditional <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> investors. However, talk to them as well as a few are not traditionalists and may be inspired enough to give you capital-as-a-<span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span>-investment</p>
 <p>Once you have the capital it will go into whatever you have to buy and <em>the Predictable Recurring Income (PRI) fund</em>.</p>
 <p>Alternatively, you may forego borrowing any capital in which case there will not be PRI fund and co-owners must be willing and able to afford to wait for revenue.</p>

<h1>Hiring</h1>
 <p>You are not going to do any hiring, you are finding co-owners. You should repeat this, out loud, many times. Like a mantra.</p>
 <p>Since you are not hiring, you are not going to interview people. One way to not fall down the interview habit hole is to tell the person you are talking to that 1) you are looking for co-owners, 2) this is not an interview, and to 3) please, let me know when this starts to feel like one.</p>
 <p>What you are going to do is to explain that PRI fund to the co-owners who join you. Then you are goint to do a Trust Agreement with the first one.</p>

<h1>The PRI Fund</h1>
 <p>Until revenue starts to come in, the PRI Fund pays co-owners.</p>
 <p>Each co-owner declares what she needs to take home. If this figure is too high and, say, it dry the PRI fund too quickly, other co-owners will want to discuss it. In the happy path, the declared figure is agreed to.</p>
 <p>No matter, this is the importnat thing: each withdrawal from the PRI fund is <em>a personal debt</em> that each co-owner is responsible for. At some point you all may decide on a different policy, but at the very start this seems to be it. Co-owners are not selling their time for a salary as is the case in <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> land so. There is no <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> onwer, the people who draw from the PRI fund are the co-owners and responsible for what they borrow.</p>
 <p>As co-owners, you may decide put limits on time or amount, they may also decide to take on the debt themselves, but that&rsquo;s up to you. Later, as revenue starts to come in, the PRI is repaid and, say, the borrowed capital that went into it may be paid off along with its upside. Once the PRI fund is paid off all earned dividents&mdash;what is left after paying off expenses, etc.&mdash;go to the co-owners.</p>
 
<h1>Trust Agreement</h1>
 <p>Do a Trust Agreement with the first co-owner in the team. This is a guide to an exploration among would-be co-owners to make sure that they are or can get aligned and they want to work with each other. Even if this is a relative or somebody you know very well, don&rsquo;t skip doing the Trust Agreement. Maybe it turns out to be perfectly boring or you may discover surprises along the way.</p>

 <p>For subsequent co-owner candidates, any co-owner can go through the Trust Agreement with them.</p>

<h1>Expressed Alignment</h1>
 <p>Since you have co-owners, and no boss, you still to somehow align on what needs to get done, etc., and that is what the Expressed Alignment tool is about,</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <img
   src="/assets/img/en-alignment.svg"
   width="70%"
   alt="">
 </div>
 <p>Co-owners should get together as soon as possible to figure out answers to the questions in the Expressed Alignment below.</p>
 <p>The Mission will change often as one project finish it and the other starts. The Purpose less often, but could change as new co-onwers join. The Impact should not change at all, at least not without a deep discussion (<em>i.e.</em>, this is equivalent to creating a new company),</p>
 <div class="_center">
  <table class="_background">
   <tr>
    <th>Impact (what for?)</th>
    <td>what impact they want to make (<em>i.e.</em>, be remembered by). For example, <span class="_quotespan">Improve people&rsquo;s health.</span></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Purpose (why?)</th>
    <td>Why are we doing this for? For example, <span class="_quotespan">Easy to get, healthy foods.</span></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>Mission (what? when? how?)</th>
    <td>What are doing, when, and How? For example, <span class="_quotespan">We already have a partner farm that will harvest by end the of April. We mean to sign up the first 100 customers by the end of March.</span></td>

<h1>The <span class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s! Mobile App</h1>
 <p>There is a mobile app for recognizing contributions which the app converts to <spann class="_paradigm">RAD</span>s.</p>
 <p>Co-owners recognize anything they see as a contributions. Contributions may range from a tangible benefit to the company (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="quotespan">&hellip; found us a place to store return merchandize for free.</span>) to something more intangible (<em>e.g.</em>,  <span class="quotespan">&hellip; took the time to talk to X and helped her get out of a crisis she was going through.</span>)
