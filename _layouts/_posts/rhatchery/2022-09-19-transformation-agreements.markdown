 <p>I think we know what the rHatchery is: We want to help <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses transform into healthy companies. And we are developing tools: transformation agreements.</p>
</div>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <p>I think we are getting a better idea of what the rHatchery is: We want to help <em><span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> businesses</em><a href="#en01"><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a> transform into <em><span class="_paradigm">RADICAL</span> companies</em>. We want to engage with businesses that want to get away from the <span class="_paradigm">FIAT</span> ways and want to get on the path of becoming healthy companies.</p>
 <p>We came up with many different ways of doing this and a few tools.</p>

<h1>Trust Agreements</h1>
 <p>Jose came up with a tool we call a <em>Trust Agreement</em>.<a href="#en02"><sup id="bm02">2&nbsp;</sup></a> Each would-be co-owner answers these questions for herself while everybody takes note. Then, they come up with a narrative that touches on all these topics.</p>

 <p>We were surprised by how well this worked to bring out the concerns of the people involved. People felt safe enough to let out all kinds of things about themselves that made them vulnerable. So far, we&rsquo;ve done it with early adopters, so we don&rsquo;t have the full picture, yet, but what we do have is very reassuring. One the comments we heard is that many organizations never get to this level of trust, even after several years of operations.</p>
