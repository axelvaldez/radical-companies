 <p>Lazy. Greedy. Cowardly. These are violent words, the words of gloating and  shaming.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You lost because you are lazy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Greedy bastard, aren’t you getting enough?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You didn’t win because you didn’t dare to, coward.&rdquo;</p>

 <p>Lazy. Greedy. Cowardly. These are violent words, the words of gloating and  shaming. The words of competition. Typical behavior, even when we are being nice.<a href="#en01><sup id="bm01">1&nbsp;</sup></a></p>

<h1>It Won’t Work</h1>
 <p>Even when <em>we say</em> we want to collaborate, we are most likely competing, aiming to dominate. That’s all we’ve learned and all we see in the world around us. And, so, that’s what we do even when we intend to do otherwise.</p>

    <td style="width:60%; ">
     <p>Name dropping is a tool of competition.</p>
     <p>In the FIAT world, you have to build up your credibility before people listen to you, and quoting &ldquo;experts,” “authorities,&rdquo; and other well known people builds your credibility.</p>
     <p>So, you learn to do it all the time hoping that one day it will let you get in the real race.</p>

<h1>Let’s Compete</h1>
 <p>We have learned this throughout our lives, just by watching the (financially) successful adults around us.
 <ul>
  <li>Raising your voice to shut others down.</li>
  <li>Interrupting to establish dominance.</li>
  <li>Talking (and talking) for a long time.</li>
  <li>Adding &ldquo;please&rdquo; at the end of direct orders.</li>
  <li>Repeating yourself, over and over.</li>
  <li>Even saying &ldquo;sorry, but that’s what I feel&rdquo; after a show of aggression is an act of competition. Even if you <em>are</em> sorry, the damage is done.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Competition also means&hellip;</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Dividng people. The &ldquo;strong leader&rdquo; mindset makes the boss special, above the people who work for him.</li>
  <li>Other lines of division,
   <ul>
    <li>Owners and employees.</li>
    <li>Middle class and poor.</li>
    <li>House owners, house renters, apartment dwellers.</li>
    <li>Men and women.</li>
    <li>Juveniles, Adults, Old.</li>
    <li>Organized religions.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Polarized people are easier to lead by the nose. People help each other to not submit. They are a pain to control.</li>
  <li>Taking hopefulness and dignity out out of work that others have to do for me, because they are not owners.</li>
  <li>Hopefulness and dignity things lie outside the work I need them to do.</li>
  <li>Only coins count as motivators.</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Collaborate Out of Love</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Listening.</li>
  <li>Paraphrasing.</li>
  <li>Celebrating.</li>
  <li>Adding to others ideas.</li>
  <li>Jumping in to help is asked to.</li>
  <li>Disagreesing if you don’t like something.</li>
  <li>Don’t punch holes in others&rsquo ideas to &ldquo;win.&rdquo;</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Collaboration also means&hellip;,</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Disagreeing when you think it is called for. Then working on alignment, which sometimes takes lots of effort.</li>
  <li>The capacity to create something together.</li>
  <li>To have my attractor dominate. It becomes meaningful when everybody agrees with me. It becomes practical when everybody works on it. It may take violence to make all agree.</li>
  <li>Multiple views.</li>
  <li>Moving towards a common attractor, making it meaningful.</li>
  <li>Creating the conditions for this RADICAL attractor to become meaningful to others.</li>
  <li>No violence is ever allowed to be involved.</li>
  <li>What we are doing is meaningful to all involved.</li>
  <li>I work with people who are always ready to help me find meaning and dignity.</li>
  <li>There is no boss. We align, and we work and we create. It’s all decentralized but cogent.</li>
  <li>Everything is fully transparent. No exceptions.</li>
  <li>We consider all we do an experiment. It either works as expected, or we learn.</li>
 </ul>
