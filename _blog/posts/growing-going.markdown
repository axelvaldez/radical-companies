 <p>It is not "breaking out" or "growing free." It is about growing and going.</p>
</div>

<h1></h1>
 <p>Ownership is freeing. Fiat ownership applies to the people who own the business. Co-ownership lets lose everybody who embodies a company.</p>
 
<h1>Jose Contreras</h1>
 <p>A case in point is Jose Contreras, a dear friend and my partner at rEnchilada,
  <ul>
   <li>He spent a bit over a year in prison</li>
   <li>He was the first employee of Nearsoft, a business that I had founded.</li>
   <li>He went on to work for well-know companies.</li>
   <li>He writes poetry.</li>
   <li>He has a facility with words.</li>
   <li>He came up with the <em>rEnchilada</em> concepts to help others.</li>
   <li>Internally, rEnchila is going to staff with co-onwers (the r stands for Radical) of underrepresented people. Single mothers, people of color,  
  </ul>
 
<h1>rEnchilada</h1>
 <p>Jose&rsquo;s idea was to unify the Sales process into a Sales Stack that leads to revenue growth.</p>
 <p>Businesses get leads by whatever means. SDR (Sales Development Reps) calls them or emails them. Finally, Sales qualify a few as <span class="iquo">ready to buy now.</span>
 <p>Big companies do all of this in-house, smaller companies contract for each piece for each piece. But there is still no process. Jose&rsquo; idea was to unify all of that into a single process.</p>

<h1>Butâ€¦</h1>
 <p class="iquo">Somebody must be doing it already!</p>
 <p>That my first reaction. Then I did some research and I came up empty handed. I talked to some of my friends in Sales and they pointed out that even in big companies, there is no process. Sales is a sink or swim and what goes is whatever the sales people learned in their previous job.</p>
 <p>Salesles people have to make their financial quotas, and tnat is what tey are measured by.</p>

<h1>Alignment</h1>
